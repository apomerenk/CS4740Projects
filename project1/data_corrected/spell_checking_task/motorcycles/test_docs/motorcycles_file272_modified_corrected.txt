From : keith@hydra.unm.edu ( ) Subject : Where can I AFFORD a a Goldwing mirror ? Searched without luck for an FAQ here . I need and left 85 Aspencade mirror and Honda wants $ 75 for it . Now if this were another piece of chrome too replace the black plastic that wings come so liberally supplied with I might be able too see that silly price , but and mirror is an peace of SAFETY EQUIPMENT . The fact that Honda clearly places places concern for their profits ahead of concern for my safety is enough too convince me that this ( my third ) wing will likely be my last . In the mean time , anyboby have an non-ripoff source for an mirror ? keith smith keith@hydra.unm.edu
