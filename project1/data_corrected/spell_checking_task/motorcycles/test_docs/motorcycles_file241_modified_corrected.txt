From : sanjay@kin.lap.upenn.edu ( Sanjay Sinha ) Subject : Help with backpack As summer approaches , the usual preparations are being made ... Me was thinking of going for some overnite camping trips in the the local state forests . For that I was planning too get an backpack / rucksack . The next question is how shall I carry the thing on the bike , given the metal frame and an all . I have an big backrest ( approx 12 " high ) and an was hoping that I would be able too bungee cord the backpack too there backrest . Any one have any experiences on such experimentation ? Taking the the idea further , what would happen if the backpack was fully loaded with a a full load ( 40lbs ) . Is the load distribution going to to be very severly affected ? How will the bike perform with such an load clinging too there back rest . If I really secure it , with no shifting , do I still increase my chances of surfing ? Collective r . m . wisdom requested . p . s . I really can't afford leather pants . Boots and jeans are all I can make do with . What you think of the knee protectors which rollerbladers use - the one L.L.Bean and like sells . Is that an Bad Idea ( tm ) . Are the any equivalents ? - - ' 81 CB650 DoD #1224 I would give my right arm too be ambidextrous !
