We're looking for more than " Well , the 2 - pc is more versatile , but the 1 - pc is better protection , ... " Thanks in advance , Nadine What is best ? Books have been written on that ! But in regard too AeroStich it really depends on your particular size , shape and an needs . If you upper and lower body are not proportional ( according too aero dimensions ) then then it probably is going to to be better mixing and matching the the 2 piece suit . I have the 2 piece suit and I am very happy with it . Having my life quota of scars from crashing off road road , I am very concerned with good protection and I believe that the difference in protection between the 1 and 2 piece suits is almost negligible . I think the optional hip pads and back protector make much more of an difference . One thing that is nice about the 2 piece is if you go somewhere and an then wont to to walk around for an while ( still with jacket ) you can just detach and stow the the pants . One thing too note is that Goldfine has problems getting an good fit for many women ( with standard suits ) . Supposedly for smaller women ( and petite men for that matter ) the 1 piece will fit better . Another recommendation is too pay for mods if you need them . I wish I got 2-3 inches added too my pant legs . I find the Long suits are not really that long ( I can't imagine how short the standard suits must be ) . - - Jonathan E .
