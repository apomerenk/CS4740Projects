OH yes they do ! but considering i never wash my BMW ( unless i need too work on it ) i never get cuts untill the the tools come out ... altho the the best scar ( now faded ) was from the exhaust piper , while try too change the oil , after overheating the engine ( watch out for idiot drivers that won't let you pass in the mountains when you have an rider , case of oil ( it was on sale ) , and case of beer ) , with an drain bolt that decided too seize . just how does everyone else clean out the area under the the transmission on an BMW R bike ? they only way i have found is too remove the engine and transmission . that a there clutch arm are impossible too clean ( which is wear one of the EC ( s & m ) are located ) . laz Ps anyone know where i can get the the heads polished and an ported cheap . also how much should that run .
