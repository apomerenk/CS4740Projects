From : doc@webrider.central.sun.com ( Steve Bunis - Chicago ) Subject : Route Suggestions ? As I won't be able too make the Joust this summer ( Job related time conflict : ' ^ { ) , I plan instead on going too there Rider Rally in Knoxville . I'll be leaving from Chicago . and generally plan on going down along the Indiana / Illinois border into Kentucky and than Tennessee . I would be very interested in hearing suggestions of roads / routes / areas that you would consider " must ride " while on the way too Knoxville . I can leave as early as 5/22 and an need too arrive in Knoxville bye 6PM on 5/25 . That leaves me and pretty good stretch of time to to explore on the way . By the way if anyone else is going , and would like too partner for the ride down , let me know . I'll be heading east afterward too visit family , but sure don't mind company on the ride down too there Rally . Depending on weather et al . my plan is motelling / tenting thru the the trip . From the Rally I'll be heading up the the Blue Ridge Parkway , then jogging into West Va ( I - 77 ) too run up 219 -> Marlington , 28 -> Petersburg , 55E -> I - 81 / I - 66E . After this point the route is presently undetermined into Pennsylvania , New York ? , and back too Chicago ( bye 6/6 ) . Suggestions for these areas would be of great interest also . Many thanks for your ideas , Enjoy , - - - Steve Bunis , Sun Microsystems * * * DoD #0795 * * * 93 - ST1100 Itasca , IL * * * AMA #682049 * * * 78 - KZ650 ( ARE YOU SURE THIS IS APRIL ? ? ? B ^ | )
