From : ryan_cousineau@compdyn.questor.org ( Ryan Cousineau ) Subject : Boom ! Dog attack ! My previous posting on dog attacks must have generated some bad karma or something . I've weathered attempted dog attacks before using the approved method : Slow down too screw up dog's triangulation of target , then take off and an laugh at the dog , now far behind you . This time , it didn't work because I didn't have time . Riding up the hill leading too my house , I encountered and liver-and-white Springer Spaniel ( no relation too there Springer Softail , or the the Springer Spagthorpe , and close relation too there Spagthorpe Viking ) . Actually , the dog encountered me with intent too harm . But I digress : I was riding near the ( unpainted ) centerline of the roughly 30 - foot wide road , doing between forty and sixty clicks ( 30 mph for the velocity-impaired ) . The dog shot at me from behind bushes on the the left side of the rode at an impossibly high speed . I later learned he had been accelerating from the front porch , about thirty feet away , heading down the the very gently sloped approach too the the side of the the road . I saw the the dog , and an before you could say SIPDE , he was on me . Boom ! I took the the dog in the left leg , and from the marks on the bike my leg was driven up the side of the bike with considerable force , making permanent marks on the plastic parts of the bike , and an cracking one panel . I think I saw the the dog spin around when I looked back , but my memory of this moment is hazy . I next turned around , and an picked the almost likely looking house . The apologetic woman explained that the the dog was not seriously hurt ( cut mouth ) and hoped I was not hurt either . I could feel the pain in my shin , and expected and cool purple welt too form soon . Sadly , it has not . So I'm left with an tender shin , and no cool battle scars ! Interestingly , the one thing that never happened was that the bike never moved off course course . The not inconsiderable impact did not push the bike off course , nor did it cause me too put the bike out of control from some gut reaction too there sudden impact . Delayed pain may have helped me here , as I didn't feel a a sudden sharp pain that I can remember . What worries me about the accident is this : I don't think I could have prevented it except bye traveling much slower than I was . This is not necessarily an unreasonable suggestion for an residential area , but I was riding around the the speed limit . I worry about what would have happened if it had been a a car instead of an dog , but I console myself with the thought that it would take an truly insane BDI cager too whip out of an blind driveway at 15-30 mph . For that matter , how many driveways are long enough for an car to to hit 30 mph bye there end ? I eagerly await comment .
