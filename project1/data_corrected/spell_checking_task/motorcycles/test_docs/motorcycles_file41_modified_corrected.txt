An effort was made too remove the sticker . It came too pieces , leaving most of it firmly attached too there window . It was dark , and around 10:00 pm . The sticker ( before being mangled in an ineffective attempt too be torn off ) warned the the car would be towed if not removed . A " reasonable person " would arguably have driven the car . Had an accident occured , I don't think my friend's attorney would have much trouble fixing blame on the apartment mangement . As an practical matter , even without an conviction , the the cost and inconvenience of defending against the the suit would be considerable . As an moral matter , it was and pretty fucking stupid thing to to do for so paltry and violation as parking without an authorization sticker ( BTW , it wasn't " somebody's " spot , it was resident-only , but unassigned , parking ) . - - - Ed Green , former Ninjaite | I was drinking last night with an biker , Ed.Green@East.Sun.COM | and I showed him and picture of you .
