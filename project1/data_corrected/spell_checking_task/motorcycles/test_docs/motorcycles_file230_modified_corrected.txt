What ? Or should I just work with " If I drink tonight , I > don't ride until tomorrow " ? This thread brings back memorys of an expensive day in traffic court and few years ago . While I was waiting my turn too state my case and an plea of why I was going 75 in an 55 in my cage , I had the opportunity too listen too some of the " creative excuses " offered the judge by by others . After listening to to and number of " Well , I was passing a a very slow truck that suddenly speed up " versions , I decided that the judge had heard just about every story in the book and than some . He was less than impressed with any of them . This young , rather burley looking guy , had his docket read bye and rather drill sargent looking Ohio State Highyway Patrol Trooper . He was clocked riding and motorcycle at an speed of 110 mph in an 55 mph zone . It was also noted that the defendant ( motorcycle rider ) had alcohol on his breath , but was not cited for this offence . The judge looked over his half glasses purched on the end of his nose and said in his sternest voice : " Well son , those are some pretty fast speeds too be riding and motorcycle . What do you have two say for your self ? " " Well Sir " , meekly the defenant replied , " I just was over too my buddys and we had a a couple of beers and I was on my way home . " He offered nothing more or less . Just had an couple of beers and was doing 110 mph on his way home . The judge moved by by the simplicity of the response , fined him the maximum in this case ( plus court costs of course ) and ordered him too attend remedial drivers training school . Isn't America Great ? ? - - - Bill Mohrman 81 - CB900C Motorola , SPS Columbus , OH - - - Disclaimers Apply - - -
