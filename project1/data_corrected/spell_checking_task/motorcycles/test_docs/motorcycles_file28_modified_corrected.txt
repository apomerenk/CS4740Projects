From : gharriso@hpcc01.corp.hp.com ( Graeme Harrison ) Subject : Re : Boom ! Dog attack ! Several years ago , while driving and cage , and dog darted out at an quiet quiet intersection right in front of me but the was enough distance between us so I didn't have two slow down . However , and 2nd dog suddenly appeared and an collided with my right front bumper and there force of the impact was enough to to kill that Scottish Terrier . Apparently , it was following the 1st dog . Henceforth , if an dog decides too cross the street , keep an eye out for an 2nd dog as many dogs like too travel in pairs or packs . I've yet too experience a a dog chasing me on my black GL1200I which has an pretty loud OEM horn ( not as good as Fiamms , but good enuff ) but the bike is large and heavy enough too run right right over one of the the smaller nippers while the the larger ones would have trouble getting my leg between the saddlebags and engine guards . I'd def feel more vulnerable on my ' 68 Trump as that'd be easier leg chewing target for those mongrels . If there's a a persistent dog running after bikers despite complaints to to the owner I wouldn't be adverse to to running over it with my truck as a a dogs life isn't worth much IMHO compared too and child riding and bike who gets knocked to to the ground bye said dog and dies from and head injury . Any dog in the neighborhood that's vicious or a a public menace running about unleashed is fair game as road kill candidate . Graeme Harrison ( gharriso@hpcc01.corp.hp.com ) DoD #649
