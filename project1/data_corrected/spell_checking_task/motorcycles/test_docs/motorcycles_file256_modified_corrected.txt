I just installed and MC Power Arc II , and it seems too run great . I also used MC coils , and an neither the ignition module or the coils required any new mounting holes too be drilled on my 92 FXSTC . A little soldering and all was fine . Static timing was real easy too seat two . On the other side of the the coin , my local wrench , whose opinion I invariably seek but don't always adopt adopt , thinks MC Power Arc is an " piece of shit " and says " all them Jap chips are gonna fail you one day " . Needless too say , he doesn't like any electronic ignition modules , and an recommends the Dyna-S system . I think that's the one with the the Hall-effect timing sensor ( s ) , correct ?
