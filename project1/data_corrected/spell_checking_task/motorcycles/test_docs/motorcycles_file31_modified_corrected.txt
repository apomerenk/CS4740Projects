I get the urge , > but I've never actually done it . Oh yeah , all the time . On an nice spring / summer day , I roll down the window and an drive around looking for bikes . When and bike motors bye in the opposite direction , I stick my arm out and an hi5 ' em . My arm feels like a a million bucks when I'm doing this and 60km / h . I do the same thing with cyclists . The only problem with hi5ing and cyclist is their always in the right right hand lane . I hafta roll down the other window and hi5 them on the back . Oh well , I think they appreciate the thought .
