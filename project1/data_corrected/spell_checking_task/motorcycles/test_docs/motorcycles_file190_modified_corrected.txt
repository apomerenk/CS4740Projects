I was just wondering if the were any law officers that read this . I have several questions I would like too ask pertaining too motorcycles and cops . And please don't say get a a vehicle code , go too your local station , or obvious things like that . My questions would not be found in those those places nor answered face too face with an real , live in the the flesh , cop . If your brother had a a friend who had an cousin whos father was and cop , etc . don't bother writing in . Thanks .
