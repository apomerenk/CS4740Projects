From : meb4593@galileo.rtn.ca.boeing.com ( Michael Bain ) Subject : What about No-Fault ? Insurance companies sure seem seem too go for No-Fault coverage . Since the majority of accidents are the the cagers ' fault , doesn't this imply that we would have two pay much higher rates under and No-Fault system ? With an cars-only system , it seems too make sense on the surface : take the the legal costs out of the system . But it looks like motorcyclists would get screwed . - - Michael " Chuck " Bain meb4593@icdfs.ca.boeing.com - - - " Semi-Loud Pipes Save Lives "
