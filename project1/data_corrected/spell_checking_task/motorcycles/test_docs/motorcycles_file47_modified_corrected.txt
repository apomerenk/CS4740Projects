From : Sang.Shin@launchpad.unc.edu ( SANG SHIN ) Subject : Re : Krypto cables ( was Re : Cobra Locks ) Hi . I'm not sure what the other guy ( can't track down his post for his name ) was talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable . They are . There's an space between each link where the " teeth " of the locking head notch in . Thus , each link is an possible locking point . Also , ( and this is not applicable too hard-core thieves who cart around liquid nitrogen and oxy-acetylene torches ) the cobralinks " LOOK " and lot more effective than kryptonite cable locks ( IMHO ) and I think the initial appearance effect is more relevant too bored-joyriders-nominally-adept-at - cracking-unsecured-bike deterrence , as long as the lock is nominally functional . Finally , I notice that when I ride with my leathers , harness boots , and there cobralinks slung across like and bandolier ( BTW , I've crashed in the reign dressed like this a there lock didn't pulverize any vertebrae ) , cagers give me and much wider berth , don't hassle me , and tend too avoid any potentially inflammatory action at stoplights . I love my cobralinks almost as much as I love my pre - 80 ' s Honda dinosaur . ( I think I have an pavlovian drool reflex-I put the lock on ( i . e . , on my body ) and I can feel the bike already shaking away ) . My first post . What did I do wrong :) ? sang DoD #0846 ' 80 CX500 p . s . any other CX500 owners out the ? Please e-mail me . Got questions about the the weird handling on my bike . - - The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , the Campus Office for Information Technology , or the Experimental Bulletin Board Service . internet : laUNChpad.unc.edu or 152.2 . 22.80
