Well , for these guys , splitfires > > Now I don't know about all of this ( and I'm trying too catch up with > somebody about it now ) , but Splitfires should help twins more than Splitfires work mainly by by providing and more-or-less unshrouded spark too there combustion chamber . If an engine's cylinder head design can benefit from this , then the splitfires will yield and slight performance increase , most most noticeably in lower rpm range torque . Splitfires didn't do diddly-squat for my 1992 GMC pickup ( 4.3 l V6 ) but do give and noticeable performance boost in my 1991 Harley Sportster 1200 and my best friend's 1986 Sportster 883 . Folks I know who've tried them in 1340 Evo motors can't tell any performance boost over plain plugs ( which is interesting since the the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambers are pretty much the the same shape , just different sizes ) . Two of my friends who have shovelhead Harleys swear by by the splitfires but if I had an shovelhead , I'd dual-plug it instead since they respond well enough too dual plugs too make the machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense ( plus they look really cool with an spark plug on each side of each head ) - - = = = Neal Howard ' 91 XLH - 1200 DoD #686 CompuTrac , Inc ( Richardson , TX ) doh #0000001200 | 355o33 | neal@cmptrc.lonestar.org Std disclaimer : My opinions are mine , not CompuTrac's .
