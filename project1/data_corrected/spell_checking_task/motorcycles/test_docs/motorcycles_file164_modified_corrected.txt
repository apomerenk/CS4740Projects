From : CGKarras@world.std.com ( Christopher G Karras ) Subject : Need Maintenance tips After reading the service manual for my bike ( Suzuki GS500E - - 1990 ) I have a a couple of questions I hope you can answer : When checking the the oil level with the dip stick built into the the oil fill cap , does one check it with the cap screwed in or not ? I am more used to to the dip stick for an cage where the stick is extracted fully , wiped clean and an reinserted fully , then withdrawn and read . The dip stick on my bike is part of the oil filler cap and an has about 1/2 inch of threads on it . Do I remove the cap , wipe the stick clean and an reinsert it with / without screwing it down before reading ? The service manual calls for the application of Suzuki Bond No . 1207B on the head cover . I guess this is some sort of liquid gasket material . do you know of an generic ( cheaper ) substitute ? My headlight is an Halogen 60/55 W bulb . Is the and easy , brighter replacement bulb available ? Where should I look for one ? As always , I very much appreciate your help . The weather in Philadelphia has finally turned WARM . This weekend I saw lotsa bikes , and there riders ALL waved . A nice change of tone from what Philadelphia can be like . . . .
