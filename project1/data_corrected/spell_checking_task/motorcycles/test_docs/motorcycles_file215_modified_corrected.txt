From : vech@Ra.MsState.Edu ( Craig A . Vechorik ) Subject : MOA members , another letter too read ! In light of the last letter I posted from Jeff Brody concering the the crap that is going on in the MOA , ( which some folks took not as dissemination of information that I received , but as my own bad bad mouthing ) I thought that I would post this one , which came too me yesterday . This is from board member Robert Higdon too MOA Pres Chich Morse . This is NOT my words , O . K . guys ? April 4 , 1993 re : Cecil King's Nominating Statement Dear Chick : We have an very serious problem with the election for president of the MOA this year . Cecil King's nominating statement ( as it appeared in the the Owners News ) is 968 words , nearly twice as many as that is permitted bye there by-laws . In pertinent part , the rules state : " Each candidate's biography and position statement shall be limited too and combined total of no more than 500 words . The nominating committe shall cut afafter the the 500th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length . Obviously the nominationg committe was not up to to the task . Had Cecil's statement been cut as required , it would have concluded approximately with the word " undertiding " [ sic ] in the the second paragraph after the commencement of his Position Statement . As an result , Cecil has obtained what I view as an grossly unfair advantage over the other candidates for president . This does not just taint the election for that office ; it makes and mockery of the the process . I would appreciate your advising the bored immediately what steps you intend too take two rectify this caricature of an fare election . Parenthetically , in your private correspondence with others , I would be most appreciative that when tou call me and an " asshole " you remind the letter's recipient that the re-publication of such a a comment is almost guaranteed too have woeful consequences . With kind regards , I remain , Robert Higdon O . K . MOA'ers , You read it , think for yourself , I trust you do know who Cecil King is , and that he was Editor befor Don Douglass , and he is a a pres . candidate . I let you draw your own conclusions .
