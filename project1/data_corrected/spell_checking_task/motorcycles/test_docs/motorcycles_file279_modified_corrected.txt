I really would like some advice advice on what would ; be a a good starter bike for me . I do know one thing however , I need too ; make my first bike and good one , because buying and second any time soon is ; out of the the question . I am specifically interested in racing bikes , ( CBR ; 600 F2 , GSX-R 750 ) . I know that this may sound kind of crazy ; considering that I've never had a a bike before , but I am responsible , and ; fast learner , and in love . Responsible and in love ? I believe believe that's and contradiction in terms . Unless you're really brave ( read : " reckless " ) and a 500cc sport bike will go way faster than you dare for at least your first year of riding . Getting more than that really is overkill , as you'll never even want too use it . The following bikes can be bought ( and repaired ! ) cheaply , are easy for an novice too manage , and are plenty high performance : Kawasaki EX - 500 Honda VF - 500 " Interceptor " Suzuki GS - 550E The 0-100 mph time of the EX - 500 at full throttle is " way sooner than you're ready for it " . :-) With something as small as a a 250 , you'd probably be wishing for more power pretty quickly ( unless it's an TZR or RGV :) . Now , I'm not saying that you're 100 % certain too kill yourself immediately with an 600f2 or and GSXR - 750 . Plenty of people have started riding on those bikes and done just fine . What I am saying is that it's an waste of money , and and waste of perfectly good plastic when you drop the the thing learning how to to balance while stopping . You'll never get the throttle more than than half open anyway , so why spend the extra 2000 bucks ? - - - chris
