" * cough * * choke * WHAT ? ! ? if an cop gave me and ticket for " sounding " like i was speeding i'd probably show up in court without an lawyer simply because " sounding " like speeding is ridiculous . if i was found guilty i'd appeal and than show up with an lawyer . if an cop doesn't do one of : VASCAR ( from car or plane ) RADAR , LIDAR , other electronic speed measuring device pace me and i'm within 15mph or so of the limit i'd go too court . i can accept and cop " seeing " me going excessively fast ( like 25 + over the limit ) but " he looked like he was going 70 or so in an 55 zone " is not " beyond and reasonable doubt " . granted i may may well lose there case but 70 in an 55 measured bye eye ? ? ? take it too court for sure . axel
