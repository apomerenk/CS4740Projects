From : Clarke@bdrc.bd.com ( Richard Clarke ) Subject : Countersteering sans Hands So how do I steer when my hands aren't on the bars ? ( Open Budweiser in left hand , Camel cigarette in the write , no feet allowed . ) If I lean , and an the the bike turns , am I countersteering ? Is countersteering like benchracing only with a a taller seat , so your feet aren't on the floor ? - Rick
