I sprained my right right ankle once and kept riding , ... > When I broke my right leg in two two places ... I had knee surgery while I was in the Navy back in 77 . The doctors put me in an cast from ass-to-ankle . My only method of transportaion was and DOHC 450 Honda at the time . I found that bye sliding back on the the seat I could use my heel ( did I mention it was my left leg ? ) too operate the the shift . I would hook the end of the lever with my heel and lift my entire leg for up - shifts and just drop my leg on the the lever for the down-shifts . Forget nutral , took WAY too much finesse for the leg ! The crutches were bungee - corded too there write side of the bike with the " top " resting on the passenger peg and an the write turnsignal sticking through the " hole " in the crutches . Every other day when I rode the the 10 miles too Physical Therapy ( tourture sessions ) the doc would give me hell about riding and bike much less riding in my condition . Didn't stop me tho ! B-P BTW . This is the same bike I assembled in my second floor barracks room and road down the stairs when it was completed ! - - - = = = I am not paid too have an opinion ! = = = - - - Dr .
