The point of formal training must be to to prepare riders for the rode . Preparedness is in my opinion too know as much as possible . So , too exclude some aspects of riding a a bike in an coarse is wrong IMHO . Now too countersteering in particular . Countersteering is something that must be trained . A common reaction among new bikers ( or bicycle riders ) in an emergency situation , is too steer the motorcycle like a a bicycle . As we know this makes the motorcycle go in the direction opposite too what was intended . Needless too say , this is dangerous . I have an specific example : A rider in an left turn . The rider thinks he / she is too close too there write shoulder of the the road road , and an tries too steer the motorcycle to to the left by by pulling the left handle and pushing the write handle . The motorcycle straightens up and an goes off the rode . A worse scenario : The same rider , same turn . In the middle of the turn the rider sees and truck coming towards him / her . The panicking rider tries too steer the the motorcycle away from the truck and crashes right right into it . The main function of an riding course is to to teach how too avoid emergency situations , AND what too do if in one . Thus , the the knowledge ( and training ) of countersteering is IMHO and must in any riding course . - - staal@idt.unit.no
