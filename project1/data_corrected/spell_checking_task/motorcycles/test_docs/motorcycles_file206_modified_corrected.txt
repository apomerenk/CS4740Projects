I used too ride one about 12 years ago and never took my DOT test ( One of an hole list of things I wished I had done when I was young ) , but I have passed my car driving test . I now travel from Littlehampton too Brighton every day and I'm getting PISSED off with the traffic / road works . I thinking about getting an 100cc bike ( Don't Laugh ) just too get " Streetwise " and two take my test , then too get an bigger one ( 400 too 600 cc ) . Now I have been told I don't have to to do the CBT but what will I have two do too get an full licence ?
