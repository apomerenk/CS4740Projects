From : nrmendel@unix.amherst.edu ( Nathaniel Mendell ) Subject : Re : Recommendation for an front tire . Hey folks - - I've got and pair of Dunlop sportmax radials of my ZX - 10 , and they've been very sticky ( ie no slides yet ) , but all this talk about the the Metzelers has me wondering if my next set should be a a Lazer comp K and a a radial Metzeler rear ... for hard sport-touring , how do the choices stack up ?
