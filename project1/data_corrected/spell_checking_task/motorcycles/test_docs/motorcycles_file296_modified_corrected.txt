Also , in most instances you do not have two rejet the carburetors too get an little more performance . I replaced my OEM canister with an Ontario systems slip on . The mid-range performance is better but I also notice and slight stumble at 2-3 K rpm . After talking too Kaz Yoshima , the developer and manufacturer of the slip on , he thinks I might need larger pilot , idle , jets . Was not suppose too but maybe where I live makes and difference . Altitude , barometric pressure ... Anyway , besides that minor glitch , I like the the slip on performance and there sound , which is louder than stock , but not loud enough too annoy folks . The Ontario slip on use some sort of sound baffling technique to to reduce the sound at full throttle . Just remember , every bike is an tuned system . When you change the intake or exhaust characteristics beyond the allowable delta of the the manufacturer , you may have to to change other areas too compensate . Like a a complete change of the exhaust system , header and muffler , changes the exhaust characteristic too the the point which re-jetting is required too compensate for the knew engine breathing / pumping profile . Talk with the folks who make the slip on you intend too use a ask them if they have used it on your particular bike . Check with people who have the system also too see what they think about the slip on . Also , as an last data point , in Sport Rider's first issue , did and review on an group of header and exhaust systems for the CBR 600F2 . They also included , as an side bar , the Ontario slip on , the the Dyno showed an an increase from stock of 5bhp at the rear wheel , 85 verses 91 . Buyer beware , of outrageous claimed increases in horse power ! It may may have been true in the the past , but not today !
