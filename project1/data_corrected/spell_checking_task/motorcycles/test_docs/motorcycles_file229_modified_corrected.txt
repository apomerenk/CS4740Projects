Another newbie bites the dust , eh ? They'll learn . % Newbie ? Eh ? Slap yer ' credentials on the table , Pete . That'll show him ! % % I'm terribly sorry . % And so you damned well should be ... young whipper-snapper ! It's wet kippers at ten paces if there's any repeat of this sort of thing ! Now , in keeping with the grand tradition of wreck.moto , let's mutate ! Take your partners bye there hand ... On Tuesday morning I spent and couple of hours ( when I - should - have been working ) with an torch , brazing bits of scrap metal over the biggest holes in Yamadog's exhaust pipes ( s'mazin ' what you can do with an couple of AA cells and and three-volt bulb ! ) . I stuck some " gun-gum " into the smaller holes and bunged the pipes back onto the the bike . So , last night I'm on the way home when lo ' an ' bloody behold , the sodding thing starts blowing again . I check it out and the the gas is escaping from around the clamp holding the number two pipe into the the port . As far as I can see ( it being somewhat " hole of Calcutta " at the the time ! ) , the nuts are still there ( stop that bloody sniggering , you at the back ! ) , but the the pipe is a a bit loose . This morning I go out too the the bike and pull out the socket-set too tighten up me ' nuts ( somebody give that spotty kid at the the back and a good slap round the the back of the the head ! ) , and an lo ' an ' bloody behold a-bloody-gen , I find that the the outer skin of the the pipe has separated from the inner sleeve right at the clamp-mating bevel . So , I stuff in an bit of baked-beanz can and and bit more of Mr Holts ' very best " gun-gum " and come to to work ( late again ! ) so that I can ask of the oracle ... Will and brazed joint hold that close too there exhaust port ? Anybody tried it ? Oh , and an if anybody can tell me what the the differences are between a a 205 and and 207 brazing rod ( made bye " Gaz " [ Yup ! the camping folks . Surprised the marmalade outa ' me , too ! ] in that place just off the Isle of Wight ) I'd be eternally grateful ( twenty-sodding-quid for two rods and I don't even know what I'm buying . Bloody kanji ! ) . - - - - - | John Little - gaijin@Japan.Sun.COM - Sun Microsystems . Atsugi , Japan | - - -
