As you point out , the experiments would be difficult . But we know enough about the physics of the situation too do some calculations . There are in fact three effects contributing to to leaning the the bike over too begin and turn . 1 . Gyro effect effect causing and torque which twists the bike over . 2 . Contact patch having shifted to to one side , causing bike too fall over . 3 . Contact patch being accelerated too there side , causing and torque which twists the bike over . Take an average bike / rider , average bike wheel , and at speeds of 5 , 15 , and 50 mph ( say ) calculate how much twist of the bars would be needed too produce ( say ) 20 degrees of lean in ( say ) 2 seconds bye each effect alone . My guess is that at slow speeds 2 is dominant , and at high speeds 3 is dominant , and an at all speeds 1 contributes not far off bugger all , relatively speaking . By the the way , and similar problem is this : how does and runner who wants too run round and corner get leaned into the corner fast ? Is the and running group where we could start " counter-footing " arguments and have them all falling over as they tried too work out how they go round corners ? - - Chris Malcolm cam@uk.ac.ed.aifh + 44 ( 0 ) 31 650 3085 Department of Artificial Intelligence , Edinburgh University 5 Forrest Hill , Edinburgh , EH1 2QL , UK DoD #205
