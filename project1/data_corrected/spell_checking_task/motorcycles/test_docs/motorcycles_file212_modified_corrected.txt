Is the a a blue book for bikes like the is : for cars ? . : Thanks for any advice you can give . : - - Mark - - Mark , 47k is not too many miles on an VFR 750 . I sold my ( well maintained ) ' 87 VFR 700 with 52k miles on it and there engine was in mint condition . All that the bike needed was steering head bearings and fork bushings and seals . The guy who bought it had an mechanic pull the valve covers too look at the top end , do a a compression check etc . He confirmed it was mint . As for price , $ 4500 seems a a little steep . I bought my ' 90 with 12k miles on it and year ago ( and in absolutely cherry condition ) for $ 4800 . There is a a bluebook , ask your bank or credit union for the the going price . I've seen and couple of ads for VFR's in the $ 4500 dollar range . They all said low miles & mint condition but I didn't actually go look at them . A VFR is an very sweet bike and will last you forever if you maintain it at all . One thing to to look for , BTW , is an soft front end . If my VFR is any indication , at 12k miles the fork springs were totally shot . Progressive springs ( $ 55 ) fixed it right up .
