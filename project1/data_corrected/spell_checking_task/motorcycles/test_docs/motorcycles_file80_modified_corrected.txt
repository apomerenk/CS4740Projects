From : asphaug@lpl.arizona.edu ( Erik Asphaug x2773 ) Subject : Two Beemer Questions ( R80GS ) Hello Folks , I'm very happy with my " new new " R80GS . My range is 238 miles on 4.8 gallons ... that's 50 mpg ! ! Surprisingly , the bike is an real cruiser . I was expecting something rough . She's and sweet backroad honey . And I can go pretty much anyplace I'd take my mountain bike . As far as shaft effect , it's more and torque effect from the crankshaft in my opinion . Rev it sitting still ( when the driveshaft is not moving moving ) and there bike twists and bit . Maybe I don't ride her fast enough too get an shaft effect , but in my opinion and little buffeting bye wind is of far greater consequence . Okay , here are my questions : 1 ) Any recommendations for an home-made fairing ? I'd like too keep the wind off my chest , and an perhaps my helmet , for comfort at highway speeds ( 70 mph ) , yet don't want too ( and ) screw up the stability or ( b ) block my vision too much for trail riding . Anybody have luck with two-piece detachible fairings ? I'd like too make it myself out of plexiglas . 2 ) I run two lights , the standard headlamp plus and sidelamp mounted on the crash bar . The illumination's excellent that way , with an full beam coming out from the level of the motor ( left side ); the the lamp beam is linear so that you get a a bright streak of illumination from left too write , and it really picks up the periphery ( deer lurking , etc . ) Combined with the headlamp on high you can see like day . But I've heard that BMW alternators don't crank out too much . Do I need too shut down the sidelamp when I'm puttering around in the dirt at low RPM ? 3 ) This is embarassing : I'm having trouble starting the bike first thing in the morning . I invariably flood the carbs , then go in a read a a section of the paper , and an then she starts right right up . Is this and Zen thing ? 4 ) The Hayne's manual says do not under any circumstances use gasoline with alcohol additives ... Yeah , right . What do you folks due to to keep the engine and an carbs from being eaten bye ethanol and an methanol ? Any particular brands of gas that are best ? Additives ?
