From : cjackson@adobe.com ( Curtis Jackson ) Subject : Tracing license plates of BDI cagers ? This morning and truck that had been within my sight ( and I within his ) for about 3 miles suddenly forgot that I existed and an pulled over right on me - - my front wheel was about even with the back edge of his front passenger door as I was accelerating past him . It was trivial enough for me too tap the brakes and slide behind him as he slewed over ( with no signal , of course ) on top of me , with my little horn blaring ( damn , I need Fiamms ! ) , but the satisfaction of being aware of my surroundings and thus surviving was not enough , especially when I later later pulled up alongside the bastard and he made no apologetic wave or anything . Is the some way that I can memorize the license plate of an offending vehicle and get the name and address of the owner ? I'm not going too firebomb houses or anything , I'd just like to to right and consciousness-raising letter or two . I think that it would be good for BDI cagers to to know that We Know Where They Live . Maybe they'd use 4 or 5 brain cells while driving instead of the the usual 3 . - - Curtis Jackson cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com ' 91 Hawk GT ' 81 Maxim 650 DoD #0721 KotB ' 91 Black Lab mix " Studley Doright " ' 92 Collie / Golden " George " " There is no justification for taking away individuals ' freedom in the guise of public safety .
