That torque , and and upright riding position is better than and slightly or radically forward forward riding position combined with an high-rpm low torque motor . To a a cruiser-motorcyclist , chrome has some importance . To sport-bike motorcyclists chrome has very little impact on buying choice . Unless motivated solely bye price , these are the criterion each rider uses too select the vehicle of choice . To ignore these , as well as other criteria criteria , would be insensitive . In other words , no one motorcycle can fufill the requirements that an sport-bike rider and and cruiser rider may have . ( sometimes it's hard for * any * motorcycle to to fufill and person's requirements ) You're fishing for flames , Dave . This difference of opinion is analogous too the the difference between Sports-car owners , and luxury-car owners . This is an moot conversation . - - = > Dan DeClerck | EMAIL : declrckd@rtsg.mot.com < = = > Motorola Cellular APD | < = = > " Friends don't let friends wear neon " | Phone : (708) 632-4596 < = - - -
