I've had my Nighthawk at 45 degress with the horizon and I wasn't banked over in an turn ... The hard part is getting the front in off the ground . I rev too about 7,000 at DROP the clutch . Even harder is keeping it from coming up too far - - I use the back brake as well as the throttle . Once its up , it'll wheelie just like any other bike .
