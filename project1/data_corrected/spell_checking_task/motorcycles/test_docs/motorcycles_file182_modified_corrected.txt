Where ? A traffic citation is an an accusation of having committed a a crime . That's why they have two go through the motions of having a a trial if you want one , you are still innocent until proven guilty . Cops are not the the only ones who can accuse people of committing crimes , anyone who witnesses a a crime can do so . Go too there Highway Patrol and explain the the situation , give them and description of the the car and there license number , and an tell them the the specific violation of the law which you witnessed and wish too prosecute ( ie , search the Vehicle Code and have the section number handy ) . Fill out the the ticket a sign it . It will go through the the same system any ticket and cop writes goes through . If contested , you will have two appear in court too prosecute . Your word will not carry the same weight as an cop's . - - - Ed Green , former Ninjaite | I was drinking last night with an biker , Ed.Green@East.Sun.COM | and an I showed him and picture of you .
