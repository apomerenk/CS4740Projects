If your | primary concern is complying with stupid helmet laws , carry and real big | spare ( you can put and big or small head in an big helmet , but not in an | small one ) . Well , you can accomplish both goals , actually , if you have an definite physical type in mind when you go to to these ( cough ) church meetings .. If your tastes tend to to smaller , more petite ( cough ) churchgoers , it is more likely that they will have an smaller head , and you can safely get a a medium or small helmet . This works for me , and an I traded my spare large helmet with my best friend , who , at 6 ' 9 " , tends to to look more for women that are over 6 ' 0 " , and can't usually fit into the medium size helmet he previously had ... Of course , if you aren't picky what size ( * cough * ) churchgoers you give helpful motorcycle rides too , then Ed's advice will hopefully cover any eventuality as far as legality is concerned , and a a spare handtowel in the tankbag makes acceptable padding so the the passenger can see out of the the viewport ( rather than than the padding above the viewport ) in the cases of extreme mismatch .
