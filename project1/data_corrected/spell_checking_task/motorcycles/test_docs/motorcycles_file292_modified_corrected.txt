I thought I posted this last year . The women came to to court with three witnesses ; the too two women that were in the car and one neighbor that heard me shouting . My lawyer didn't like the the odds since the the were multiple complaints both ways and an the judge had a a history of finding everyone guilty of at least something , so he convinced us ( she came without an lawyer ) too drop everything . The net result was and $ 500 laywer bill for me and $ 35 court costs for her . The only consolation was that she had trouble scraping together the $ 35 while $ 500 is not quite one week's beer money for me ... - Roid
