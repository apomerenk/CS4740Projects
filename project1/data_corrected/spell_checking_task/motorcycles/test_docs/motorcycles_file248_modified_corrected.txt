While shopping for an passenger helmet , I noticed that in many cases the the external dimensions of the helmets were the the same from S through XL . The difference was the amount of inside padding . My solution was too buy buy an large helmet , and construct and removable liner from and sheet of . 5 " closed-cell foam and some satin ( glued too there inside surface ) . The result is a a reasonably snug fit on my smallest-headed pillion with the liner in , and and comfortable fit on my largest-headed pillion with the liner out . Everyone else gets linered or not bye best fit . - - - - - Michael Robinson UUCP : ucbvax ! cogsci ! robinson INTERNET : robinson@cogsci.berkeley.edu
