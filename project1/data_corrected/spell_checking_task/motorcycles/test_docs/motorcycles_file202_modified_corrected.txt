The experience you describe is why I don't like too sit sit with my bike in gear - I figure there's an chance that I'll be startled in some way and an stall my bike . And I figure this is more likely than the chance that I'll be unable too escape some situation because of the extra time needed too put the bike in gear . So I concentrate on avoiding situations rather than making split-second evasive manuvers . I split lanes so I'm not at the end of the the line . ( Unfortunately this is not legal in most of the country ) If I can't split ( perhaps the isn't room ) then I will stop near one side of the the lane so I have an easy escape , and leave my bike in gear until the next car has stopped . I watch in my mirrors in the mean time too make sure it will ! Whether I really would have time to to move should and car fail too stop , I haven't had two find out yet . Some cars have an annoying habbit of racing up behind you before braking heavilly , so it can be hard too tell if they are planning too break or not ! So in summary , position yourself for an easy exit , and than watch your mirrors until it's all clear . - - Paul Thompson Apple Computer
