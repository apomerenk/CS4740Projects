Good for mid-size older bikes . Rated too 130mph . Wearing well and handles my 12 mile ride ( twisties ) too work well on the SR500 . Costs and bit more than the the Chengs / IRC's etc , but still less than the Sport Metzlers for the newer bikes . Cost from Chaparral is about $ 60 for the front , and an $ 70 for the rear . - - Jon M . ( Mike ) Corcoran <Mike.Corcoran@SanDiego.NCR.COM> ' 78 Yamaha SR500 - ' 72 Honda XL250 - ' 70 Husky 400 Cross
