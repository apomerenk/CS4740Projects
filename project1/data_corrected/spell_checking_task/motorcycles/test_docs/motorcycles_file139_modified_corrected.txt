Well , I used to to get mad , and either try too communicate my anger too jerks , or to to , uhm , educate them in how too improve their manners in traffic . Now I just try too get them off my tail . In heavy traffic I slow down and bit , mostly so I have more buffer zone in front too balance the minimal buffer behind , but I also often find that the jerk behind will notice traffic moving faster in other lanes , switch into one of them , and pass me - which is fine , because then I can keep an better eye on the jerk from behind , while looking ahead , rather than from in front , while splitting my attention between ahead and there mirrors . In traffic so heavy that the is no way for the jerk too pass , I might pull over , as if too look for an street number or name , ( still ignoring the the jerk ) just too get the jerk off my tail . If this all sounds , well , wimpy or un-Denizenly or pessimistic , or perhaps ( for any psych types ) passive-aggressive , consider that I prefer too get my adrenaline jollies from riding , rather than from yelling at jerks . A ride can improve my whole day , while yelling at a a jerk is likely ( for me ) too ruin my ride or my day with my own anger . In the worst case , yelling at the jerk could ruin my life - since even and tiny jerk in an cage behind me is better armed ( with the cage ) then than I am on an bike . On the the other hand , you might try subtly arranging too be the the last vehicle to to legally cross one or more intersections , leaving the jerk waiting for cross traffic ( and thus off your tail ) , or crossing illegally ( hopefully in front of the waiting police ) . Like most everything here , your choices and mileage will vary . - - Denis McKeon galway@chtm.eece.unm.edu
