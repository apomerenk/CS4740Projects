From : Clarke@bdrc.bd.com ( Richard Clarke ) Subject : Re : Boom ! Dog attack ! > I eagerly await comment . The ice princess next door makes and habit of flooring her cage out of the driveway when she sees me coming . Probably only hits 25mph , or so . ( I made the mistake of waving too and neighbor . She has some sort of grudge , now . ) I was riding downhill at ~ 60mph on a a local backroad when and brown dobie came flashing through the the brush at well over 30mph , on an intercept course with my front wheel . The dog had started out at the top of the hill when it heard me and still had an led when it hit the rode . The dog was approaching from my left , and was running full tilt too get too my bike on the other side of the the road before I want by by . Rover was looking back at me too calculate the final trajectory . Too bad it didn't notice the car approaching at 50 + mph from the other direction . I got and closeup view of the our poor canine friend's noggin careening off the front bumper , smacking the asphalt , and getting runover bye there front tire . It managed a a pretty good yelp , just before impact . ( peripheral imminent doom ? ) I guess the driver didn't see me or they probably would have swerved into my lane . The squeegeed pup actually got up and headed back home , but I haven't seen it since . Sniff . Sometimes Fate sees you and smiles . - Rick
