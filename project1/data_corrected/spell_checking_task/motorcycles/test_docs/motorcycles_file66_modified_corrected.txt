Suggestions ? An even better strategy is to to leave less of an buffer between you and there car in front , but enough too manuver around it . Keep the bike in 1st gear with the the clutch handle squeezed in ( how's that for engaged / disengaged ? ) , until the are two cars stopped behind you . When the next BDI cager comes screaching in , simply ride up along side of the car in front of you . You don't need too panic and do it , or you will pop the clutch and stall the the engine . Do is smoothly , just rapidly . The cage in front of you will provide MUCH better protection than anything else ( particularly empty road ) . - - - Ed Green , former Ninjaite | I was drinking last night with a a biker , Ed.Green@East.Sun.COM | and I showed him a a picture of you .
