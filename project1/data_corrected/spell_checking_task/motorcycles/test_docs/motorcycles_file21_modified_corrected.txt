IF you can remember too tuck properly , the bits that are going too take most punishment with the the gear you have will probably be your feet , then hips and an knees . Get boots then trousers . The gloves come last , as long as you've the the self control too pull your arms in when you tuck . If not , get good gloves first - Hands are VERY easily wrecked if you put one down too steady your fall at 70mph ! ! The other bits heal easier . Once you are fully covered , you no longer tuck , just lie back and an enjoy the ride . Best of all , take an mean of all the contradictory answers you get .
