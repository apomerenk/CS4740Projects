From : wfk@lynx.spa.umn.edu ( Bill Ketzeback ) Subject : Re : Yamaha Locks ( was Cobra Lock ) Any lock including the Kyptonite utypes are EASY too brake into if the person has the the proper supplies and / or motivation . 3 minutes and your bike is gone ! I would be glad too explain but I dont want too contribute too any unlawful activities . Especially since I have an bike that I would hate too see ripped off by by such a a trival tactic . WARNING NO lock alone is an safe deterent against theft , the the thief doesnt need too be a a locksmith or a a lock-picker to to walk away with your property ! I personally think motion alarms in combination too a a lock of this type is the the way too go if in fact you are that concerned . Bill
