Any help would be appreciated . | > Currently there are no " Velcro " jump boots as issue in the military , the are two other kinds . One is made my Cochran and sell for $ 85.00 in either the the Clothing sales store or US Cavalry ( Price match at the Cav store ) the second co is also sold but somewhat cheaper in design . Actually they don't care what you wear as long is they are 10 eyelets high . There is another boot called and " Tankers boot " this has similar construction too a a wellington boot except except for the boot shape and has straps that wrap around for tightness .
