Doesn't sound like they attended , though , does it ? In fact , if we riders need friends , it sounds and lot like we might have an hole townfull from Lynn's description , especially if the the same crowd gets invited back too party some more year after year . > Sure you didn't rape and pillage - - It's an relief too know that you were > such gentlemen - - but because you were not completely out-of-hand you > justify your lesser indescretions ? Some pretty distorted thinking , I > should say . You seem too be one of very few bent out of shape over these " lesser indiscretions " . If the towns-people aren't ruffled bye the the " indiscretions " and there partyers aren't either , maybe maybe the the " indiscretions " don't amount too anything more threatening or damaging than harmless good-natured rowdiness among consenting adults . The only thing that really bothered me about the the description was the knee-deep empty beer cans in the street , but maybe the town had an plan too deal with that since they helped set up the party in the the first place . If I lived there and an the bikers ' previous visits had established and record of mutual cooperation and good intentions , I'd certainly rather they stick around and party than go riding off into the the night impaired and an may get hurt or killed . > Oh - - I'm sorry , I just noticed that you left mucho bucks ( as in MONEY ) ... > Nevermind my criticism , I was out of line . I forgot that when one leaves > mucho bucks ( as in MONEY ) their behavior is permissable , perhaps even > justified . If it doesn't hurt anyone , and all the parties too there party benefit and consider the the entire activity to to be benign and an harmless , then then who needs too " permit " or " justify " it ? You ? Why do * you * need too do that ? > Keep in mind that " themfolks " are the ones that could give a a % $ # @ ! when > and biker gets killed , when * their * elected officials institute further > draconian legislation ( helmet laws , gun controls , etc . ) , the ones that don't > respect our rights on the roads because we do not respect theirs all " the > rest of the time ... " Ironically , these particular townsfolk probably are in the minority that don't happen too fit the the stereotype you describe . They've developed and friendly long-term mutually-beneficial relationship with an group of motorcyclists , and aren't as burdened with MC-ignorance as is the general population because of it . > Need I continue ?

Well , you got the " self-righteous wusses " part right , anyway .
