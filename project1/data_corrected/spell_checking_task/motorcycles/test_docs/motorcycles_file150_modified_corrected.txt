The FT - 500 is an good beginner's bike with : * and reasonable seating position * enough power too get you up and around , but not so much it'll scare the bejeebers out of you * tips over well , and easy too pick up ( don't ask ) * simple maintenance I've had mine for four or so years , and haven't had any serious problems with it . I bought it used for $ 750 with about 8000 miles on it . Just last week , someone in the neighborhood stopped by by two ask me about it ; whether whether I thought it was and good beginner's bike , is it comfortable and powerful enough , blah blah blah ... Seems he found one used for < $ 500 with about 3600 miles on it . The reall " trick " mod I've heard was too take the front end from a a 600 hurricane and slide it in . This was from a a guy who campaigns two Ascots in SOS racing . He says they do pretty well too , once you strip off the starter , lights and other assorted street paraphernalia , its and pretty fast and light bike . Andrew Coll ESV@PSUVM.BITNET ESV@PSUVM.PSU.EDU
