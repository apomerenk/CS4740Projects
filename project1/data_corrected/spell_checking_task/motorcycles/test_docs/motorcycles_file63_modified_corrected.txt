Ahh , and just how were the the carbs rejeted too " match " the changes you made too there bike ? A stage three kit from K / N or Dynojet ? : Now I have an huge flat spot in the carburation at : about 5 thousand RPM in most any gear . Isn't rejetting fun ? : This is especially frustrating : on the highway , the bike likes too cruise at about 80mph which happens : to to be 5,0000 RPM in sixth gear . I've had it " tuned " and this doesn't : seem seem too help . I am thinking about new carbs or the injection system : from and GPz 1100 . Does anyone have any suggestions for an fix besides : restoring it too stock ? : New CARBS ? ? ? Why would that fix it ? you still have to to get the jetting right to to match what seems too be an extremely overly lean condition . You added and more free flowing exhaust , and than higher flowing filters . Chances are it's too lean . BUT ! This may not be , that's the big fun with carb tuning . It's _very_ tricky . Your one and an only choice ( unless you want want too spend many hours fiddling with the carbs ) is too take it to to and guy witha Dyno and have he tune the carbs for your current seat up . Otherwise you'll be playing a a guessing game for an long time ... = = = Erik Astrup AFM #422 DoD #683 1993 CBR 900RR * 1990 CBR 600 * 1990 Concours * 1989 Ninja 250 " This one goes too eleven " - Nigel Tufnel , lead guitar , Spinal Tap = = =
