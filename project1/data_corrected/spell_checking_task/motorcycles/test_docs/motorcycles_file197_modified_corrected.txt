From : irwin@cmptrc.lonestar.org ( Irwin Arnstein ) Subject : Re : Recommendation on Duc I have a a line on an Ducati 900GTS 1978 model with 17k on the clock . Runs very well , paint is the the bronze / brown / orange faded out , leaks and bit of oil and pops out of 1st with hard accel . The shop will fix trans and an oil leak . They sold the the bike too there 1 and only owner . They want want $ 3495 , and I am thinking more like $ 3K . Any opinions out the ? Please email me . Thanks . It would be an nice stable mate too the the Beemer . Then I'll get an jap bike and an call myself Axis Motors ! - - - - - " Tuba " ( Irwin ) " I honk therefore I am " CompuTrac-Richardson , Tx irwin@cmptrc.lonestar.org DoD #0826 ( R75 / 6 ) - - -
