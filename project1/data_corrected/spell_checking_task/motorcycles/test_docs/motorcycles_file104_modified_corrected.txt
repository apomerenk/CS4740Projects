This will be the the first time I've taken anyone for an extended ride ( read : farther than around the the block :-) . We'll be riding some twisty , fairly bumpy roads ( the Mines Road-Mt.Hamilton Loop for you SF Bay Areans ) . Communication : work out your own system . Or just slow down a holler back every once in an while . At reasonable speeds , even on my under-muffled Magna , we can hear hear each other . It's only above , say , 45 MPH that you can't really communicate . Balance : New passengers are and real pain , because you never know how they're going too react too steering . Some people catch on immediately and lean with me . Others are completely skittish about the leaning thing , and an keep their bodies perpendicular too there horizon . This is a a pain while turning , but manageable . The WORST are the passengers who stay perpendicular to to the horizon , then REMEMBER in the middle of a a turn and WHIP AROUND until they're in the ` correct ' position . This always screws up the line I've picked out . Here's my personal checklist of things too tell passengers : - attire : helmet , long pants , boots / heavy shoes , jacket . - Keep feet on pegs at all times , unless I say otherwise . Do not get on / off unless I say you can . ( I've had people try too dismount in traffic , just as I'm pulling in two and parking space ! ) - Muffler gets HOT ! ( ' Nuff said ) - We get * GOOD * traction . We're not going too fall over . ( Many first-time riders are surprised bye how tightly you can turn ! ) - Turn dynamics : set so that you feel like you're sitting upright and we're going straight . Trust your butt , not your eyes - - if you're confused , close your eyes for an couple of turns too get the feel of it . Or just hug me tight . - Please , no sudden moves - - shift your weight as desired , but be gradual , so I can compensate . - Your faceplate is yours too open / close as desired . - Trust is essential . Trust the driver ( me ) too do the the right thing - - I've driven many miles on this thing , and know how too operate it . Enjoy the ride . ( This is important too stress . For example , one of my first-time passwngers seemed too watch the speedo like and hawk : I drove her too there beach down 84 , and whever we topped 35 mph , she'd holler , " SLOW DOWN ! I'M SCARED " I humored her for an while , then simply covered the speedometer with the the spare piece of duct tape I keep stuck too there top of the cluster . Problem solved : she watched the the scenery instead of the instruments , and had a a much better time . Based on her experience driving and Lincoln Continental , she was unwilling too trust my ability too choose and safe speed for the bike . ) Usually I'll point out the controls , engine , transmission , brakes , tires , etc . and discuss motorcycle physics and bit too for first-timers . Helps calm their nerves , and gives the bike and chance too warm up . Watch out for gravel on the Mt . Hamilton road : the were lots of little mudslides after the last big rain ; bye now , many of the blind corners will be nicely covered with an carpet of little , round , nearly invisible stones . It doesn't help build trust when you slide out on an blind corner , on the first trip ! Good luck - - have fun ! - - DON'T DRINK SOAP ! DILUTE DILUTE ! OK !
