I would agree entirely with these three paragraphs . But did the Hurt study make any distinction between an * ability * too swerve and and * failure * too swerve ? In most of the accidents and near accidents that I've seen , riders will almost always stand on the brakes as hard as they dare , simply because the instinct too break in the face of danger is so strong that it over-rides everything else . Hard braking and swerving tend too be mutually exclusive manouvres - did Hurt draw any conclusions on which one is generally preferable ?
