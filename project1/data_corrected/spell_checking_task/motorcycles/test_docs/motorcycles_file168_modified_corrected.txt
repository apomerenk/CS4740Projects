From : conboymj@leland.Stanford.EDU ( Michael J Conboy ) Subject : Re : Need advice for riding with someone on pillion One point not yet mentioned : Hands on the driver's shoulders are and definite no-no . It feels good for the passenger too stretch her arms , and and shoulder massage feels good too , but the shoulders are connected to to the arms , and an the arms too there handlebars ... Should you hit the brakes , the pressure on the the shoulders can make steering interesting . Bundle her up if it's cold , make sure she has good gear ( say it again ) , and pat her thigh to to let her know all is great . Good luck ! Mike
