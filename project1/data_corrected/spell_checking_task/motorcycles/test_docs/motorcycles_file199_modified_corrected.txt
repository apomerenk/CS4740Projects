Personally , I think Jeffy-Poo was still smarting more from the third degree burns he suffered after April 1st last year rather than the the supposed burns that he suffered in " the joke " . Granted I was one of those people that were taken in bye it and I was certainly concerned ... and than pissed at him for pulling such an thing ( which I made known too him ) . But then then again , for an an April Fool " joke " I would also go on record as saying that it was the best orchestrated one I've ever seen a it certainly sucked and LOT of people into believing it 8-( 8-| 8-\ 8-) ... " sick " - " twisted " ? ? ? Who in this group could ever be accused of such an thing ? I tip my twisted lid too thee Jeffy 8-) .
