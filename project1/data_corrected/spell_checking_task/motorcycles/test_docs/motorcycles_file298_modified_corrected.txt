If that's the the " official line " taught in those those rider education classes you were refering too , that also don't teach countersteering , I have to to question the quality of the the classes . The " official line " in MSF curricula is as I described . Maximum braking is achieved by by applying both brakes equally , when the weight distribution is nominally even a both tires have equal normal forces , and easing off on the rear too prevent locking it , and increasing braking on the the front , as more traction is available too there front due too increased normal force due to to weight shift . The " official line " you have been taught seems ineffective on the face of it . Applying the rear brake after the front is not taking advantage of all the traction available too there rear at time 0 , and an is halving the available braking power bye using only the front at time 0 . > > Saying , " brake until the tire just begins too slide " is next too useless > > advice to to a a newbie .

Not necessarily true . " Chirping " the tire indicates impending lockup ( on most most surfaces ) , and an serves as an good guide too newbies too indicate maximum braking . I agree that totally locking the front occasionally makes one a a better rider , but it is an manuver best saved for an an experienced rider , unless you have one of those outrigger bikes like Code used too use . > In any case , for maximum braking , if ( as I suggested ) you aim to to keep > both wheels just on the point of sliding , then you'll be doing > exactly as * you * suggest ! ! True , but from the point of view of how too best * teach * riding skills ( which is how this discussion started ) , " keep both wheels just on the point of sliding " is nearly useless information . You need too teach an * technique * , or at least a a strategy , too achieve this . - - - Ed Green , former Ninjaite | I was drinking last night with an biker , Ed.Green@East.Sun.COM | and I showed him and picture of you .
