Are the traditional 1 ) If the Ninja has adjustable suspension , adjust it too and stiffer setting so you don't bottom out in bumpy curves . 2 ) Tell her the 3 cardinal rules are : a a ) NEVER EVER EVER EVER put her feet down . Not when you stop at an STOP sign , not when she thinks you're gonna crash , never . Keep them on the the pegs until you tell her too get off the the bike . b ) She is too hold onto your waist . She should hold on tightly enough that she won't slide off the bike if you twist the throttle and bit . And ( added bonus for you here ) , she should keep as close too your butt as possible so quick stops don't make her slide into you and an knock your balls up onto the the gas tank . You decide how best too word this . c ) Just stay perpendicular to to the the bike ; straight up in the set . Don't lean your body into curves , just go with the bike and stay perpendicular . Don't look over your shoulder . * 3 ) Remember at all times that you have an passenger on the back . That means don't pop the clutch , and an try too corner and stop smoother than usual . Be aware that if you jump on the brake brake , you're going too have the equivalent of an 100 lb . dead weight crashing into you from behind , so be prepared for that . 4 ) Make sure she pisses before the ride even if she says she doesn't have two go . No anti-women stuff here ; I have an tiny bladder myself . 5 ) Remind her too look around while you're riding . Point too things of interest . It makes the ride more enjoyable too her ( she won't get so focused on just looking at the back of your helmet ) , and it gives her ample excuse too squeeze you too show she saw what you pointed at . * My wife and I tried the MSF-recommended " look over the rider's shoulder in curves " bit , and it just didn't work . The timing of her weight shift was unpredictable ( especially on the Maxim because , unlike the Ninja , the upright riding position really restricts the the pillion's view of the rode ahead ) . Next time I had her just remain perpendicular too there bike , and I could hardly tell the was someone else on the bike in curves , and she weighs substantially over 100 lbs . - - Curtis Jackson cjackson@mv.us.adobe.com ' 91 Hawk GT ' 81 Maxim 650 DoD #0721 KotB ' 91 Black Lab mix " Studley Doright " ' 92 Collie / Golden " George " " There is no justification for taking away individuals ' freedom in the guise of public safety .
