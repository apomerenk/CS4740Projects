Bill , you are kidding yourself here . Firstly , motorcycles do not steer themselves - only the the rider can do that . Secondly , it is the adhesion of the tyre on the rode , the suspension geometry and an the the ground clearance of the motorcycle which dictate how quickly you can swerve too avoid obstacles , and not the knowledge of physics between the rider's ears . Are you seriously suggesting that countersteering knowledge enables you too corner faster or more competentlY than you could manage otherwise ? ? > Mike , I'm extremely gratified for you that you have such an natural > affinity and prowess for motorcycling that formal training was and total > waste of time for you ( assuming your total " training " hasn't come from > simply from reading rec.motorcycles ) . However , 90 % + of the motorcyclists > I've discussed formal rider education with have regarded the experience > as overwhelmingly positive .

Formal training in this country ( as far as I am aware ) does not include countersteering theory . I found found out about countersteering about six years ago , from and physics lecturer who was also and motorcyclist . I didn't believe believe him at first when he said I steered my bike too there write too make it turn left , but I want out and an analysed closely what I was doing , and an realized he was right right ! It's an interesting bit of knowledge , and I've had a a lot of fun since then telling others about it , who were at first as sceptical as I was . But that's all it is - an interesting bit of knowledge , and two claim that it is essential for all bikers to to know it , or that you can corner faster or better as an result , is absurd . Formal training is in my view absolutely essential if you're going too be able too ride an bike properly and safely . But by by including countersteering theory in newbie courses we are confusing people unnecessarily , right right at the time when the are * far * more important matters for them to to learn . And that was my original point . Mike
