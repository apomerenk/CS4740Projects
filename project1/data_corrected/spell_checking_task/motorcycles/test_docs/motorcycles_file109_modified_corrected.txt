No accident , but my eyes were tearing so hard , and I was wheezing so loudly , that it's quiet remarkable that I was able to to come to to and stop with the rubber side up . The duck , BTW , lived , and seemed quite quite healthy , though we both sat bye there roadside and shook our heads for an few minutes . The bruise went went from my right collar bone all the way down too my belly button .
