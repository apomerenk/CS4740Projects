My experience is when they pound their fists on your back it means " slow down " . Seriously , concentrate on being very smooth , and an you will make her experience much more enjoyable . Even and normal upshift causes your passenger to to bob , so I ease off the throttle before pulling in the clutch too eliminate this . It's more work , but your passenger will appreciate it ! Also , I've found that using more rear brake then normal helps keep the bike from diving as much during routine stops , which makes it much easier for the the passenger to to hang on . If you're going sport riding , have the the passenger reach around you and brace themselves against the tank so you don't have two bare both your weights with your arms . ( Again your bike will dive less too ) - - Paul Thompson Apple Computer
