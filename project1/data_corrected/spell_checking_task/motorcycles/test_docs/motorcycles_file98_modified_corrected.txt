I don't > have my bike yet so I need and few pieces of information : > > [ ... ] Any stories on how you all learned ? I'll tell you my story as an an example of what * not * too do . Early in 1984 I took some riding lessons from my college roommate on his old Honda CB360T . He had taken the MSF beginner's course , so I actually learned * some * of what I needed too know too ride . I proceeded to to buy and beat-up Honda CL350 for $ 400 and and $ 12 helmet and road around wearing this a a a cotton windbreaker . Then I decided to to invest in an full-face helmet ( first smart move ) . Sometime around then I also passed my road test . On May 4 , 1984 , I got caught in an rainstorm on my way home from a a 4 - mile trip . Entering the town where I lived ( and rather urban suburb ) , I had two stop suddenly for an red light that I noticed too late , skidded the rear tire out , and an was ejected face upward into the oncoming lane of traffic . Fortunately for me the the oncoming traffic was also stopped for the same red light , otherwise I might have slid under a a car and been killed . Now this is anecdotal evidence , to to be sure , but I later took the Experienced Rider Course from the MSF and saw that earlier training could have helped me greatly . In your case the need is even greater since you have nobody too help you practice even the almost basic stuff as I did . So my advice is too take the MSF beginner's course course first thing . I wouldn't even buy buy a a bike until you've taken the the course , unless you happen too pick up and real good deal and can store it someplace until you're ready too use it . > 1 ) I only have about $ 1200-1300 too work with , so that would have > to to cover everything ( bike , helmet , anything else that I'm too > ignorant too know I need too bye ) While you're waiting too take the coarse ( it might take an few weeks in DC , as I recall there the were always waiting lists in Boston ) , could you save up some more money too start out right ? Say $ 300 for riding gear , plus the cost bike , plus maybe $ 100 ( guess ) too a a mechanic too make sure the machine is safe ( assuming you economize bye buying some old beat-up machine from and private individual ) , plus insurance , plus registration and licensing fees , plus the the course , you're looking at maybe $ 600 not including the bike itself and a a reserve for ongoing maintenance . > 2 ) What is buying a a bike going to to do too my insurance ? I turn 18 in > about and month so my parents have been taking care of my insurance up > till now , and an I need and comprehensive list of costs that buying and > motorcycle is going to to insure ( I live in Washington DC if that makes > and difference ) I pay about $ 100 insurance now ( upstate NY ) but it was closer to to $ 200 in Boston ( more urban ) for decent insurance including substantial coverage for liability , which you want want unless you plan always too be poor . I'd guess DC is more like Boston than like and rural area , ergo more expensive . > 3 ) Any recommendations on what I should buy / where I should look for it ? There used to to be annual buyer's guides in the usual motorcycle magazines ; I found dozens helpful in getting an idea of what new or recent models might be available . You could probably look through past issues too size up what used bikes might be available . ( My first bike was 13 years old when I bought it so I want on my friend's advice instead . ) Also look at the bikes that you see people riding or that are parked on the street . I basically settled on my present bike by by noticing that the the were and lot of high-mileage BMW's running around and they were generally set up the the way I wanted . Nothing wrong with talking too various dealers in your area or visiting showrooms . Dealers in the Boston area , at least when I was shopping , were very nice about letting you look around their showrooms and quoting prices for bikes that weren't the the latest models ( hence cheaper ) , although I ended up buying both bikes in private sales . - - David Karr ( karr@cs.cornell.edu ) - - ' 80 BMW R65 DoD #0969 also BMWMOA , NRA , ACLU , et al .
