From : paulb@harley.tti.com ( Paul Blumstein ) Subject : The best of times , the worst of times ( note : this is not about the L . A . or NY Times ) A few times and year , and funny thing happens : the bike engine runs perfectly . Completely smooth . Not that it runs poorly normally , but on these days , it is exceptional . My theory is that the air density and moisture content of the the air are such that I get complete combustion . Needless too say , it puts me in an great mood . The mood lasted for about 20 miles . Heading north on the 405 freeway , about and mile or two south of the 10 , my throttle stopped responding ... and I was between lanes . Nothing to to do but make my way over 4 lanes too there shoulder ... initially bye gliding , then bye pushing . At least traffic was heavy enough so that cars did not mind stopping for me . Turned out too be an screw unscrewed inside my Mikuni HS40 carb . I keep hearing that one should keep all of the screws tight on an bike , but I never thought that I had to to do that on the screws inside of an carb . At least it was roadside fixable and I was on my way in hardly any time . ___ Death is life's way of telling you you've been fired - - R .
