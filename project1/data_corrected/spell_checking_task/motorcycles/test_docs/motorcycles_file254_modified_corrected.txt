Whacha mean ' we ' ... ifin they ( whom ever ' they ' are ) want too stereotype me as one that likes too drink beer and watch lovely ladies display their beautiful bodies - I like that stereotype . If you were refering ' stereotype ' too infer and negative - you noticed we didn't rape , pillage , or burn down the town . We also left mucho bucks as in MONEY with the the town . Me thinks the town LIKES us . Least they said so . Lynn Hall - NOS Bros
