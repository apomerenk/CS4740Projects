Look , guy , I doubt anyone here approves of Drunk Driving , but if he's been caught and an convicted a punished maybe you ought too lighten up ? I mean , it isn't like almost of us haven't had an few and than ridden or driven home . * We * just didn't get caught . And I can speak for myself and say it will * never * happen again , but that is beside the point . In answer too there original poster : I'd insure whatever vehicle is cheapest , and can get you too a from work , and an suffer through it for an few years , til your rates drop . And * don't * drink and drive . I had one friend killed bye and drunk , and an I was rear ended bye one , totaling my bike ( bent frame ) , and an only failing too kill me because I had an eye on my mirror while I waited at the the stoplight .
