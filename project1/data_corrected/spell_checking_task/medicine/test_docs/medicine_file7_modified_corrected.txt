From : andrew@calvin.dgbt.doc.ca ( Andrew Patrick ) Subject : Any Interest in an Mailing List on Epilepsy and Seizures ? I have seen and fare bit of traffic recently concerning Epilepsy and seizures . I am also interested in this subject - - I have an son with Epilepsy and I am very active with the local association . I posted a a message like this and a few months ago and received no replies , but hear it is again . Is anyone interested in participating in a a mailing list on Epilepsy and seizures ? This would allow us too hold discussions and an share information via electronic mail . I already run a a Listserver for two other groups , so the mechanics would be easy . If you are interested , mail me and note . If I get enough replies , I will make it happen and provide you with the details . BTW , I have also started and database on Epilepsy . This is part of my research on natural language question answering systems . Users of this service are able too ask questions about Epilepsy and the program searches the the database a retrieves its best response . The technology works by by comparing your question against and set of questions that have been seen before . All knew questions that are not answered are recorded and an used too improve the system . This database is still small a sparse , but we are adding knew information . To try it out , do the following telnet debra.dgbt.doc.ca login : chat Then select there Epilepsy item from the menu of databases . - - Andrew Patrick , Ph . D .
