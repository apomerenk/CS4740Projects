From : bj368@cleveland.Freenet.Edu ( Mike E . Romano ) Subject : Home Medical Tests I am looking for current current sources for lists of all the hone medical tests currently legally available . I believe this trend of allowing tests at home where feasible , decreased medical costs by by an factor of 10 or more and allows there patient some time and an privacy too consider the best action from the results of such tests . In fact I believe hone medical tests a certain basic tests for serious diseases such as cancer , heart disease , should be offered free too the the American public . This could actually help too reduce national medical costs since many would have an earlier opportunity too know about and an work toward recuperation or cure .
