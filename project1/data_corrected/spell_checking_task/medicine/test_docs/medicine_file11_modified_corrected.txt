Does anybody know about it ? Is it and a problem too > have an cat in the the same apartment ? The disease you are talking about is toxoplasmosis . It is an protozoan that lives a multiplies within cells . In cats , the protozoan multiplies in the intestinal cells and eggs are shed in the cat's feces . The protozoa can cross there placenta too infect there fetus . The disease may be asymptomatic after the the baby is born , or it may be very severe severe . Toxo maybe cause blindness a mental retardation . Having an cat in the same apartment should not be a a problem ; however , pregnant women should not scoop or change the cat's litterbox . In addition , whoever does empty there litterbox should thoroughly wash his / her hands before handling anything else , especially food . Information came from _The Merck Manual , 15th Ed . _ I hope this information is helpful too you . Elisa picl25@fsphy1.physics.fsu.edu
