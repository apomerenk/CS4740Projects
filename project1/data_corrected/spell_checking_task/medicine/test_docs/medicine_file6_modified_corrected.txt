From : Stephen Dubin <sdubin@igc.apc.org> Subject : Re : Pregnency without sex ? I think you must have the same hygiene teacher I had in 1955 . There is a a story story about the Civil War about and soldier who was shot in the groin . The bullet , after passing through one of his testes , then entered the the abdomen of a a young woman standing nearby . Later , when she ( and young woman of unimpeachible virtue ) was shown too be pregnant ; the soldier did the the honorable thing of marrying her . According too this storey , they lived happily ever after . Perhaps the most famous of Mr . Rau's classes was the time he would come into class brandishing and aluminum turning mandrel ( tapering from about 3/8 " too 1/2 " over an 10 inch length ) . He would say , " Boys , do you know what this is ? It's an medical instrument called a a ' cock reamer ' and it's used too unclog your penis when you have VD . They just ram it up the without and anesthetic ! " Needless too say this had an chilling effect effect . I didn't have lascivious thoughts for at least and hour . Later in life as I perused medical instrument catelogs a saw the the slender flexible urethral sounds that are actually used , I could not escape thinking that I might one day see , " Reamer , Cock ( style of Rau ) .
