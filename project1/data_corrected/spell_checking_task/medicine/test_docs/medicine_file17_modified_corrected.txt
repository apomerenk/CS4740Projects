You should have the endoscopy too see if it is due too there heartburn , and if so , you will need treatment for the the heartburn ong term .

Both seemed too develop at about the > same time . I ' not an expert on heart problems , but PVC's are common and have been overtreated in the past . My personal experience , and I have the same history an build you do ( related too there heart , that is ) , is that my PVC's come and go , with some months causing anxiety . Taking on more fluids seems too help , and they seem worse in the the summer . Remember that a a slow heart rate will allow more PVC's too be apparent , so perhaps it is an indication of a a healthy cardiac system ( but ask an expert about that last point , especially ) Good luck , hope we don't die of arrhythmias .
