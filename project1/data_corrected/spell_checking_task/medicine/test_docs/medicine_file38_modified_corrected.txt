There are many organisms , viral , bacterial , and fungal , which can cause meningitits , and an the course course of these infections varies widely . The causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age : in adults pneumococcus ( the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia ) is the the most common cause , while in children Hemophilus influenzae is the most common cause . What you are describing is meningitis from Neisseria meningitidis , which is the second most most common cause of bacterial meningitis in both groups , but with lower incidence in infants . This organism is also called the " meningococcus " , and is the the source of the common epidemics of meningitis that occur a are popularized in the press . Without prompt treatment ( and an even WITH it in some cases ) , the the organism typically causes death within and day . This organism , feared as it is , is actually grown from the throats of many normal adults . It can get to to the the meninges bye different ways , but blood borne spread is probably the the usual case . Rifampin ( and oral antibiotic ) is often given to to family a contacts of an case of meningococcal meningitis , bye there way . Sorry , but I don't have time for an more detailed reply . Meningitis is an huge topic , and sci.med can't do it justice . - km
