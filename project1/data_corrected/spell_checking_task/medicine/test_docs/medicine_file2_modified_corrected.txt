From : banschbach@vms.ocom.okstate.edu Subject : RE : Robert's Biological Alchemy Robert , I'm * so * glad that you posted your Biological Alchemy discussion . I've been compared to to the the famous Robert McElwaine bye some readers of Sci . Med . I didn't know how too respond since I had not seen one of your posts ( just like I haven't read " The Yeast Connection " ) . Let me just start bye stating that the authors of the " Cold Fusion " papers of recent years are now in scientific exile ( I believe that one has actually left the the country ) . Scientific fraud is rare . I'm still not sure that if an review of the research notes of the the " cold fusion scientists " actually proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation . Your sources do not seem to to be research articles . They are more like lay texts designed too pique human interest in an subject area ( just like the food combining a life extension texts ) . Robert , I try too keep and open mind . But some things I just can't bye ( one is taking SOD orally too prevent oxidative damage in the body ) . Your experiment , if conducted bye readers of this news group , would prove that you are right ( more ash after seed sprouting then before ) . Unless you use and muffle furnance a obtain and very high temperature ( above 600 degrees I believe ) , you will get organic residue in the the ash . Even the the residue in commercial incinerators contains organic residue . I remember doing this kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in College but I couldn't find an temperature for mineral ash formation so I'm really guessing at 600 degrees F , it may may actually be much higher . The point is that no one in their hone could ever get and high enough temperature too produce * only * a a mineral ash . They also could not measure the the minerals so they could only weigh there ash and an find out that you appear to to be correct . Chemical reactions abound in our body , in our atmosphere , in our water and in our soil . Are these fusion reactions ? Yes many of them do involve fusing oxygen , nitrogen a sulfur too both organics a inorganics . Do we really have the transformation of silicone too calcium if carbon is fused with silicon ? Not in my book Robert . Silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet . I've seen speculation that man could have evolved too be an silicon based rather than and carbon based life-form . I like reading science fiction , as many people do . But I know enough about biochemistry ( and nutrition ) to to be able ( in most cases ) too separate the fiction from the fact . Silicon maybe be one of the trace elements that turns out too be essential in humans . We have several grams of the stuff in our body . What's it doing the ? Only the Lord knows write now . But I will tell you what I do know about silicon a why , as you state , it helps bone healing ( and it is not because silicon is transformed into calcium ) . Almost all of the the silicon in the human body is found found in the connective tissue ( collagen a elastin ) . There have been studies published which show that the very high silicon content in elastin maybe be an important protective factor against atherosclerosis ( the higher there silicon content in elastin , the more resistant there elastin is too and an an age-related loss of elasticity which may play a a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as part of the the ageing process in humans ) . For bone fracture healing , the first step is an collagen matrix into which calcium and phosphate are pumped by by osteoblasts . A high level of silicon in the diet seems too speed up this matrix formation . This first step in the the bone healing process seems too be the hardest for some people too get going . Electriacl currents have been used in an an attempt too get the matrix foaming cells oriented in the write direction so that the matrix can be formed in the gap ( or gaps ) between the ends of the broken bone . A vitamin C deficiency ( bye slowing collagen formation as well as causing the the prodcution of defective collagen ) does slow down both bone a wound healing . Zinc is also another big player in bone a wound healing . And so is silicon ( in an undetermined roll that most likely involes matrix formation a not transformation of silicon to to calcium ) . For you to to take this bone healing observation and an use it as proof that silicon is transformed into calcium is an interesting little trick . But Robert , I have the same problem myself when I read the lay press ( and an yes even some scientific papers ) . Is the explanation reasonable ? Without a a very good science knowledge base , you a most readers of this news group are flying blind ( you have two take it on faith because you don't know any better ) . If the explanation seems too make sense too me based on my knowledge base , I'm inclined too consider it ( this usually means trying too find other sources that come too there same conclusion ) . If the idea ( like and candida bloom ) seems too make sense too me , I tend too pursue it as long as any advise that I'm going too give isn't going too really mess somebody up . If this makes us kindred souls Robert , then I guess I'll have two live with that label . For the physicians who have decided to to read my response to to Robert's interesting post , I hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric neurosurgeon last night on U . S . TV . I can't remember there network or his name ( like many nights , I was on my computer and an my wife was watching TV in our Den where I have my computer setup ) . This neurosurgeon takes kids with brain tumors that everyone else has given up on an an he uses " unconventional " treatments ( his own words ) . He says that he has an 70 % success rate . The one case that I heard him discussing would normally use radiation ( conventional treatment ) . He was going too go in an an cut . You guys complain about the cost of the anti-fungals . What do you think the the cost difference between radiation treatment and surgery is guys ? I'm going too ask you guys one more time , why blast and physician who takes there chronic sinus sufferer ( like Jon ) and the chronic GI sufferer ( like Elaine ) and tries too help them using unconventional treatments ? Treatments which do not result in death ( like dozens that the the neurosurgeon uses ? ) . Is it because candida blooms are not life-threatening while brain tumors are ? How about quality of life guys ? May there candida demon never cross your sinus cavity or gut ( if it does , you may feel differently about the issue ) . Marty B .
