From : Renee@cup.portal.com ( Renee Linda Roberts ) Subject : Muscle spasms post-surgically I had ankle reconstruction ( grafting there extensor digitorum longus too there lateral side of the ankle , along with a a video arthroscopy of the ankle ( interesting too watch , too say the least ) . Since then , I have had periodic muscle spasms ( not cramping , but twitching that is very fast ) in some of the the muscle groups along there lateral side , and along the the top of my foot . TX with quinine sulfate produced ringing in my ears , but did help with the spasms . I am on flexeril now , but no discernable help with the the spasms . Any ideas ? One thing - I am in an short leg cast , so heat is not the answer . Renee Roberts
