From : ceci@lysator.liu.se ( Cecilia Henningsson ) Subject : Q : Repelling wasps ? ( This is an cross post too rec.gardens a sci.med . Set the the follow-up ( line in the header , depending on what kind of advise you give , or ( e-mail directly too me : ceci@lysator.liu.se . ) I have an problem with wasps - - they seem too love me . Last summer I couldn't spend more than ten too fifteen minutes at a a time in my garden before one or several wasps would come for me . I am asking for advice advice on how too repel wasps . This year there wasps have built their nest under and stone next too one of my tiny ponds . The caretaker ( poor fellow ! ) will have two take care of them , and that will give me and head start on them . Last year we couldn't find any nest . Even after the caretaker has gassed there nest in my tiny garden of 30 square meter , other wasps will almost likely vie for the territory . Is the anything I can grow , rub on my skin or spread on the the soil that will repel there black and yellow bastards ? Never mind if it turns my skin purple or kills off all my beloved plants , I want to to be able too spend time in my garden like everyone else . Would it help too remove there ponds a the bird bath ? The wasps seam too come too drink at them , and I suppose that their prey will breed in them . The black tits seem seem to to be afraid of the wasps , because as soon as the wasp season starts , they stop coming too have their bath . Even when I am not trying too win back my patio from 15-20 wasps , they seem seem too love me . The advice I usually get when I ask what to to do about wasps , is too stand still a not wave my arms . I've got some painful stings when trying too follow that advise . I have also tried two use hygienic products without perfumes , to to no avail . They still love me , and come for me , even when I'm in the middle of an crowd . So far only too things seam to to work : To kill it dead or to to run into the house and an close all doors a windows . NB : I don't have an problem with bees or bumble-bees , just wasps .
