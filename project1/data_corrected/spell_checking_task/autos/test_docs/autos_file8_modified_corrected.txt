I find this method much better myself , too , although I do really hate it when the bolt finally comes loose a the wrench and my hand both come crashing into my face . After coming to to , which is about 15 minutes later later , I change my clothes ( because bye this time all the oil has drained * on * me ) , and ice my entire face and suck down about 20 Tylenol too ease the pain . Later in the day I then proceed with refilling the engine oil . It's just crazy how I try and change the the oil on my cars in one weekend---I go through about 3 bottles of Tylenol and 2 bags of ice . John
