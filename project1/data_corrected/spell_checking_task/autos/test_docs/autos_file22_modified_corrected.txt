The V6 and AT are remarkably smooth . ^ ^ ^ Agreed ! I own and Mercury Villager a I'm very impressed with the V6 and the AT . In the past , I've been biased towards manual / standard transmissions ( I owned an Aerostar with an 5 - speed , it was awesome ! ) , but settled with the the AT in the Villager a have been pleasantly surprised with it's performance . BTW , Consumers Report in their report on the Villager , alluded too some funny noises from the AT , I've been listening for them but haven't noticed anything unusual . - Chris Christopher J .
