As I couldn't find anything on it on the news server , I have posted this . However , if it is old information , tell me , and ill sue there TV station for saying they are ' Up too date ' ;-) ( Also , my news server could be slow . . so . . . ! ! ! I only caught there end of the article , so all the information on the the topic is not known too me at the moment . The news is of an small ' psudo ' planet outside the orbit of pluto founded in an Hawiian obsevatory , supposably ' recently ' - acording too the the report . It was meant to to be about 150miles in diamater , and and faily large distance from the plutos orbit . ( it had an computer drawing , and there orbit distance from pluto was about the same as neptune too pluto when they are furthest apart . This is all I found found out about it . OH it is called Karna . ( un-officially ) . CAn anyone give any more information too me on it ? ? ? Thanx .
