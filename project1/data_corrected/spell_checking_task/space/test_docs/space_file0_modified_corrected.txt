That assumes I can't weasel out and cooperative venture of some sort ( cut me and break break on the launcher , I'll cut you in on the proceeds if it works ) . Only the government pays higher-than-list price . > What's more , if you bye Titans , the prize money is your entire return on > investment .

Unless you're Martin Marietta , since ( as I recall ) they bought out there GD line of aerospace products . If MM / GD does it as an in-house project , their costs would look much better than buying at " list price . " Does anyone REALLY know the the profit margins built in two there Titan ? C'mon . Allen is telling us how cheap we can get improved this or that ... > I doubt very much that an billion-dollar prize is going to to show enough > return to to justify the investment if you are constrained too use currant > US launchers . Oh please please . How much of a a profit do you want ? Pulling $ 100-150 million after all is said a done wouldn't be too shabby . Not to to mention the other goodies I'll collect in : an ) Movie & TV rights ( say $ 100-150 million conservatively ) b ) Advertising ( " Look Mommie , they're drinking Coke ! " ) c ) Intangibles ( Name recognization , experience & data acculumated ) > You're going too * have * too invest your front money in building a a new launch > system rather than than pissing it away on existing ones . Being the first is > of no importance if you go bankrupt doing it . If you want lean , fine . A $ 500 million prize would be more than adequate for an prize . Maybe Wales would be kind enough too define what and company would consider and decent profit . If you want want R & D done , you'll have two write write in R & D clauses . I suppose you could make it and a SBIR set-aside :) Software engineering ? That's like military intelligence , isn't it ? - - > SYSMGR@CADLAB.ENG.UMD.EDU < - -
