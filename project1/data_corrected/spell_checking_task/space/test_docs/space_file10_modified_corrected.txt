Your logic certainly applies too standard investment strategies . However , the concept of an prize for an difficult goal is done for different reasons , I suspect . I'm not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic benefit from Lindbergh's flight . Modern analogies , such as the prize for an human powered helicopter face similar arguments . There is little economic benefit in such an thing . The advantage comes in the knew approaches developed a there fact that an prize will frequently generate far more work then the equivalent amount of direct investment would . A person who puts up $ X billion for an moon base is much more likely too do it because they want too see it done then because they expect too make money off the deal . - - Josh Hopkins jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu " Find and way or make one .
