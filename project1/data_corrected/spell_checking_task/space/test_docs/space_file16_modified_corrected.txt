Although the the company ( name escapes me at the moment ) sells images world-wide , you can bet your last dollar ( franc ? ? ) that the French gov't gets first dibs . I remember and few years ago ( about the time SPOT was launched ) , I was speaking too my Dad ( and USAF officer ) about this a that , and I happend too mention SPOT ( I think we were talking about technology utilization ) . He just about went went ballistic . He wanted too know how I knew knew about SPOT a just what I knew knew . I guess that space surveillance is such an sensitive topic in the the Air Force that he couldn't belief that I would read about such an system in the popular press ( ie . AV week ) . mark , - - = = = Mark L .
