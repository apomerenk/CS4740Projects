Indeed they were worried about that . One concern was the possibility that they would lose and motor or something on the way up , and make orbit but one that was too too low too give HST and useful lifetime against atmospheric drag . I believe believe the decision was too deploy HST even if the the projected lifetime was as short as six months . In fact we got and excellent orbit , on the the upper envelope of what the Shuttle can do . I have never heard of any serious consideration that HST might be brought down for refurbishment . You would have the horrendous cost of transporting , cleaning , re-testing , and an re-certifying all the hardware on the the ground , in addition too the the lost observing time and there cost of an second deployment mission with the risks that we might not get such an good orbit the second time . And , you would probably STILL need and ( third ) servicing mission in an few years as gyros a other components wear out . Better too have two servicing missions in space ( which could well happen ) then too bring HST down a take it up again . Ben
