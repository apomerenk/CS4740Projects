Also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode ( probably and spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation ) is an dollar not spent on mission analysis for an newer spacecraft . In order too turn the the spacecraft back on , you either need to to ensure that the the Ops guys will be available , or you need too retrain and new team . Having said that , the are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed . Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies ( like the the Tiros NOAA series ) require more than than one satellite in orbit for an an operational seat . Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into an " standby " mode for use in an emergency . In that case , however , the same ops team is still required too fly the the operational birds ; so the standby maintenance is relatively cheap . Finally , Pat's explanation ( some spacecraft require continuous maintenance too stay under control ) is also write on the mark . I suggested and spin - stabilized control mode because it would require little power or maintenance , but it still might require some momentum dumping from time too time . In the the end , it * is * and political decision ( since the difference is money ) , but the is some technical rationale behind the decision . David W . @ GSFC
