The Army started funding the laboratory and had jurisdiction untill there late 1950s when NASA took over . The early research conducted at the the Laboratory lead too many applications there first being Jet-assisted takeoff rockets for aircraft . I think this should explain where JPL got it's name , I should know , I worked the for five wonderful years . - - - mike . > - - > - - - > Jim Cobban | jcobban@bnr.ca | Phone : (613) 763-8013 > BNR Ltd . | bnrgate.bnr.ca ! bcars 5 ! jcobban | FAX : (613) 763-2626
