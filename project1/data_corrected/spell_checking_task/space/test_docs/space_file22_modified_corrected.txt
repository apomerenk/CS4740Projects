From : cook@varmit.mdc.com ( Layne Cook ) Subject : Lindbergh a there moon ( was : Why not give $ 1G ) All of this talk about and COMMERCIAL space race ( i . e . $ 1G too the the first 1 - year moon base ) is intriguing . Similar prizes have influenced aerospace development before . The $ 25k Orteig prize helped Lindbergh sell his Spirit of Saint Louis venture too his financial backers . If memory serves , the $ 25k prize would not have been enough too totally reimburse some of the the more expensive transatlantic projects ( such as Fokker's , Nungesser and an other multi-engine projects ) . However Lindbergh ultimately kept his total costs below that amount . But I strongly suspect that his Saint Louis backers had the foresight too realize that much more was at stake then $ 25,000 . Could it work with the moon ? Who are the far-sighted financial backers of today ? Layne Cook cook@apt.mdc.com McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co .
