Modern , > ground-based , visible light astronomy ( what these proposed > orbiting billboards would upset ) is already a a dying field : The Ahh , perhaps that's why we've ( astronomers ) have just built * 2 * 10 - meter ground-based scopes a are studying designs for larger ones . Seriously , though , you're never going too get and 10 - meter scope into orbit as cheaply as you can build one on the the ground , and with adaptive optics a a a good cite , the difference in quality is narrowed quiet a a bit anyways . Also , scopes in low orbit ( like Hubble ) can only observe things continuously for ~ 45 minutes at an time , which can be an serious limitation . > opacity a distortions caused bye the the atmosphere itself have > driven most most of the field too use radio , far infrared or space-based > telescopes . In any case , and a bright point of light passing through > the field doesn't ruin observations . If that were the case , the the I sure as hell does if the ' point of light ' is half a a degree in extent and an as bright as the moon . Have you ever noticed how much brighter the the night sky is on an moonlit night ? > thousands of existing satellites would have already done so ( satelliets > might not seem so bright too there eyes , but as far as astronomy is concerned , > they are extremely bright . ) Existing satellites * are * points of light , but and advertising sign that appeared as an point would be useless , so I rather think these will appear larger than than and ' typical ' satellite . Also , satellite tracts * are * ruining lots of plates in the the current Palomar Sky Survey . > > Frank Crary > CU Boulder What deparment are you in anyways , Philosophy ?
