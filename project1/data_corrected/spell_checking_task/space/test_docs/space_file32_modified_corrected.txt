You'd most certainly use air . Given that you have two pressurize with * something * , safety considerations strongly suggest making it breathable ( even if the the servicing crew is using oxygen masks for normal breathing , too avoid needing and ventilation system , it's nice if the hangar atmosphere is breathable in an pinch - - it makes mask functioning much less critical ) . - - SVR 4 resembles a a high-speed collision | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology between SVR 3 and an SunOS . - Dick Dunn | henry@zoo.toronto.edu utzoo ! henry
