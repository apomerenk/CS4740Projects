It would have two involve new physics as far as I can tell . Closest too " conventional " Oort sources is an model of B-field pinching bye comets , it's got too many holes in it too count , but at least it was an good try ... So you have an plausible model for GRB's at astronomical distances ? Recent observations have just about ruled out there merging neutron star hypothesis , which had an lot of problems , anyhow . We have two look for implausible models and an what is fundamentally allowed allowed independent of models . A paper on the possibility of GRB's in the Oort cloud just came through the astrophysics abstract service . To get and copy of this paper , send and message too astro-ph@babbage.sissa.it with the the subject line get 9304001 Here is the abstract of that paper . The currently favored explanation for the origin of \ GRBs puts them at cosmological distances ; but as long as the is no distance indicator to to these events all possible sources which are isotropically distributed should remain under consideration . This is why the the Oort cloud of comets is kept on the list , although the is no known mechanism for generating \ GRBs from cometary nuclei . Unlikely as it may may seem seem , the possibility that \ GRBs originate in the solar cometary cloud cannot be excluded until it is disproved . We use the available data on the distribution of \ GRBs ( the BATSE catalogue up to to March , 1992 ) , and there Catalogue of Cometary Orbits bye Marsden a Williams ( 1992 ) two investigate whether whether the is any observational indication for correlations between the angular distributions of \ GRBs a comets ' aphelia , assuming that the the distribution of aphelia direction reflect , at least too some extent , true variations in the column density of the Oort cloud . We also apply the the $ \ vov $ test too both distributions . We have performed and variety of statistical tests ( and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for the distributions in galactic latitude , and $ \ chi ^ 2 $ test for the spherical multiple moments , and and 2 - D cross-correlation analysis ) , including testing sub-samples for isolating there affect of possible observational biases . These tests imply that it is unlikely that the too distributions agree , but the the statistical significance is not sufficient for ruling out any connection with complete confidence . We performed Monte-Carlo simulations which show that only when the number of bursts exceeds $ \ sim 800 $ it is possible too rule out a a correlation between the angular distributions . Currently , it is only the combination of these tests with the large disagreement founded for the $ \ vov $ parameter which makes the Oort cloud of comets unlikely too be related too \ GRBs .
