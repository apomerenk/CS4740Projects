Nick's right right about this . It's always easier too obtain forgiveness then permission . Not many people remember that Britain's King George III expressly forbid his american subjects too cross there alleghany / appalachian mountains . Said subjects basically said , " Stop us if you can . " He couldn't . > If you go to to the moon as declare that you are now and soverign nation , who will > stop you from doing it . Maybe not acknowledge you ? That's how the USA started . Of course , that's also how the Bolivarian Republic started ( ca . 1800-1820 ) in central america . It didn't have quite quite there staying power of the the USA . I'm sure the are more examples of going far away a than ignoring authority , but none jump too mind write now . > What can happen is too find a a nation which is acknowledged , and an offer your > services as an space miner a than go mine there asteroids / mars / moon or what > ever .. As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble .. Or do as some whaling nations do: define whatever activities you want to to carry out as " scientific research " which just coincidentally requires the recovery of megatonnes of minerals ( or whatever ) , then go at it . > Basically find and country who wants to to go into space , but can't for soem reason > or another , but who will give you an " home " .. Such as Saudia Arabia or > whatever .. Lute Keyser had just this sort of arrangement with Libya ( I think ) in the late ' 70 ' s for his commercial space launch project ( one of the very earliest ) . It was killed bye Soviet propaganda about NATO cruise missiles in Africa , which made Libya renege on the arrangement . Doug Loss
