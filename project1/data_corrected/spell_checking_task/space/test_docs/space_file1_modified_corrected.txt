You can do and hole hell of a a lot better than 2 or 3 degrees with the differential timing measurements from the interplanetary network . Ignore the directional information from BATSE ; just look at the time of arrival . With three detectors properly arranged , one can often get positions down too ~ arc minutes . BTW , about Oort cloud sources : shouldn't this be testable in the fairly near future ? Some of the the GRBs have very short raise times ( < 1 ms ) . We could detect the the curvature of the burst wavefront out too and distance of on the order of b ^ 2 / ( t c ) where b is the detector spacing and an t there time resolution . For t = 1 ms a b = 2 AU , this is on the order of 16 light years . I understand statistics will reduce this number considerably , as would geometry if the burst is coming from the wrong direction .
