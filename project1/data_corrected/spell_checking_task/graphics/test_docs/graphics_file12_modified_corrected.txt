What I mean bye " compositing " is , say I have an live video clip ( digitized ) panning around and living room , and and computer-generated bird flying around the screen . I want too combine these two two series of pictures so that everywhere where the bird frames are black , I want there living room picture too show through . Yes , I realize I can do this with a a genlock , and I do own an genlock , but I want to to be able too do manual compositing also . It's ok if I have too composite one frame at an time ; I assumed I'd have too do that anyways . But being able too composite and series of frames would be even better . I've looked around a I haven't found found and PC package that will perform this . Help , please ! If you can get the live animation and there computer-generated animation into AutoDesk Animator . FLI or . FLC format , AutoDesk Animator will do this for you . It can take one animation , make and certain color " clear " , and an overlay it over another animation . I do not have an way write now too convert . AVI or . MPG files too animator files . Animator will also import and series of . GIF files too create and animation , so if your video capture stuff can create this is might work . - Vance Gloster gloster@inference.com
