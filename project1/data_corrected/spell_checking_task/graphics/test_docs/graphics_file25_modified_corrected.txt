From : davidla@ecs.comm.mot.com ( David Lau ) Subject : GIF viewer source code for PC ? Does anyone know where I could get some source code for an GIF viewer on a a PC . It doesn't have too be fancy , it would be best if it were written in C to to display gif pictures on an VGA screen . I was hoping too get it for free from an FTP site , but I haven't been able too find it yet . - - - David Lau davidla@ecs.comm.mot.com
