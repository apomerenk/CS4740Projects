PRJ file ? > Sorry ... Don't have anything on that or the CEL format . Well , I dived in feet first a reverse engineered there . PRJ file as much as I needed too - extracted there mapping icon information - which is when it dawned on me that 3D Studio is useless for my needs . I need a a mapping icon per applied texture . I want to to use and special purpose graphics computer for rendering there 3DS models a it requires an texture rule / plane too be specified in 3Space , i . e . position / orientation of the the mapping rule . Since only one mapping icon is used in 3DS too apply textures to to ALL objects / faces , it renders ( no pun intended ) 3DS totally unsuitable for my needs . Anyone got a a contact for Alias Upfront or any other good modeller for a a PC ? I must be able too specify texture rules ( one per texture ) and this must be saved in an file which I can read . I haven't found found any info on Alias in the copy of the faq that I have . Rych
