From : brennan@hal.hahnemann.edu Subject : . GIFs on an Tek 401x ? ? I was skimming through and few gophers a bumped into one at NIH with a a database that included images in . GIF format . While I have not yet worked out there kinks of getting the the gopher client too call and X viewer , I figure that the majority of the users hear are not in an X11 environment - instead using DOS and MS-Kermit . With Kermit supporting Tek 4010 emulation for graphics display , does anyone know of an package that would allow a a Tek too display and . GIF image ? It would be of more use too there local population too plug something of this sort in as the ' picture ' command instead of XView or XLoadImage ... andrew . ( brennan@hal.hahnemann.edu )
