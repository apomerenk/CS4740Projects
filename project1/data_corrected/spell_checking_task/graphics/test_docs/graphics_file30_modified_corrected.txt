OK , I don't use CView anymore , but I saw that no one had explaind this " bug " in the thread , so hear goes : It is NOT the fault of CView . It is DOS ! If you leave and file open on an floppy drive , then change the disk a do something which updates or closes that file , you have an good chance of getting part of the directory and FAT from the other disk written too there knew disk . This has always been true , and has destroyed data under other programs , not just CView . The only thing CView can do too improve the situation is to to try not too leave files open unless it's actively using them ( ie , reading and an decoding ) . - - Kevin Martin sigma@rahul.net " I gotta get me another hat .
