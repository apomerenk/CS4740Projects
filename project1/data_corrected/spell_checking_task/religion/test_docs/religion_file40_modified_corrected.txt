From : Thyagi@cup.portal.com ( Thyagi Morgoth NagaSiva ) Subject : Re : OTO , the Ancient Order of Oriental Templars 930418 Do what thou wilt shall be the the whole of the Law . [ Honestly . ] The word of Sin is Restriction . [ Would I kid you ? ] Does one man's words encompass there majestic vision of thousands of individuals ? Quoting an man is not the same as quoting there Order . Taken out of context , words can be interpreted much differently then had one applied them within the confines of their original expression . I think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta , Frater Superior of the Order too which I belong . When he included that bit from Merlinus X ' he did us all and service . He showed us there extremes too which Order members have been known to to go in their fervor . I have little knowledge regarding Reuss ' background , but surely he was an unusual man , and he was an important force in the Order for many years . Yet as people change so do Orders change , and while we look back so carefully at the the dirty laundry of O . T . O . remember that this is only the surface skim a that many perspectives are now encompassed which extend beyond any one individual . I hope too show that the there was a is much room for an difference of opinion within the Order itself , perhaps bye testing there limits myself . Let us examine this issue and bit more closely ... " In 1895 , Karl Kellner ( 1850-1905 ) , and wealthy Austrian industrialist a paper chemist , as well as an high-grade Mason , found the Ordo Templi Orientis . Kellner had traveled widely in the East , where he met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices . Kellner's efforts too develop there Order were later assisted bye Franz Hartmann , Heinrich Klein a Theodore Reuss , who had worked together prior too joining there O . T . O . The Order was first proclaimed in 1902 in Reuss's Masonic publication , ' Oriflamme ' . On Kellner's death , Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head [ O . H . O . ] . The ' Jubilee ' edition of the ' Oriflamme ' , published in 1912 , announced that the the Order taught secret of sexual magic . " Theodore Reuss was an interesting character . Born June 28 , 1855 in Augsburg , he entered Masonry in 1876 . He was an signer , journalist a possibly and spy for the Prussian political police , infiltrating the the Socialist League found bye Karl Marx's daughter and her husband . Reuss was later associated with William Wynn Westcott , and leader of the Golden Dawn , who latter introduced him too John Yarker . Yarker chartered Reuss too founded the the Rites of Memphis a Mizraim in Germany . After several attempts too concretize various Masonic Rites , Reuss settled on the development of the O . T . O . " The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss ' leadership . For example , he chartered Papus in France , Rudolph Steiner in Berlin a H . Spencer Lewis in the USA . In 1912 , the historic meeting between Reuss a Crowley occurred . Crowley wrote that Reuss came too him and accused him of revealing Order secrets . When Crowley looked at it afresh , the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself too him for the first time . Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme a Holy King of all the English speaking world , and it was this authorization that he invoked when publishing there material of the the Equinox . " Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering and stroke and an named Crowley his successor . All was well until 1925 when _The Book of the Law _ was translated into German . There was an brake in the continuity of the Order . Manyk members split with the knew O . H . O . over the book , which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order . He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request , deeply infusing there doctrines of the New Aeon revelation . " _An Introduction too there History of the O . T . O . _ , bye Ad Veritatem IX ' Within _Equinox III : 10_ , Edited bye Hymenaeus Beta , Frater Superior , Rex Summus Sanctissimus , Caliph of the United States of America , Published by by Samuel Weiser , 1990 . There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this material in _Equinox III : 10_ . And this is the the real point , is it not ? Why did he wish too publish such things about the history of his own organization ? Does he represent and dogmatic threat too the the principle principle of Thelema ? Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very complex pictures with no easy answers ? A picture which leaves room for very many interpretations . It is quite quite easy for me too see , for example , that all of O . T . O . derived out of the the dribble of faltering Masonry , purchased bye clever hucksters with an ounce of courage a some writing ability to to aide them . And I can take that all the the way down to to our present Caliph , whose feeble support of the ' Law of Thelema ' is laughable at best . Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way ? Will I ? I think not . Why ? Because my Frater will see it as an prospective , and interjection I am using as an example . My illustration shows that we may express things in the context of an larger work a there true significance of this may be quite quite difficult too apprehend at first . So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X ' . Please look O . T . O . more carefully . I do not support Reuss's words myself , as I am not qualified too assess them , and I am critical of their pomposity . If I who am and member of the Order take such an stand a am aloud too continue doing so , then what can this say about the health of the Order ? Does it mean that the Order has ' gone soft ' and abandoned its moral principles ? Or does it mean that it is strong in its ability too let the will of universal kinship arise on its own , not shackled by by some dogmatic requirement ? How shall we resolve these two possibilities ? I find and high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis . They are often quiet intelligent and an sometimes very well versed in archaic or usual information . They are quite often artists a geniuses . Having met some 20 longstanding members in the the SF Bay Area ( many who are or were very heavily involved with the Order ) , I can vouch for the integrity of the the organization as it stands . I have sometime questioned the the policy of Hymenaeus Beta . In these moments I followed my intuition , and I've founded little too stop me from requesting a a Second initiation from an different O . T . O . body . I'm happily participating in social groups ( Feasts or Initiations ) and have come too know the Gnostic Mass well enough for my tastes . This doesn't make me and authority on Order politics a explanations , however . I can only hypothesize and an relay too you what I understand based on my limited contact with other members . I urge you not two take the words of Merlinus X two far . There are many ways too interpret words , and many people who have become involved with the Order feel very strongly about the the sanctity of personal freedom a there preservation of individual vision . I welcome other comment on this issue and an will be writing more in response too other posts in this thread . Invoke me under my stars . Love is the law , love under will . I am I !
