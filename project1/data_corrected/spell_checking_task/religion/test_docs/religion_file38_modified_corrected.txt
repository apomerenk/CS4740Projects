You're admitting and lot more than that . You are admitting that your morals are situational . You are admitting that the the actions of other people and there situation you are in help too determine how you judge the the moral significance of one of your own actions . If you employ X degree of force , that's not moral , but if you employ X degree of force , but previously someone else has employed Y degree of force , and there situation is thus-and-so , that * is * moral . This is quite different from saying " Employing force on other people is immoral , period . Unfortunately , from time to to time we are obliged to to do this immoral immoral thing for reasons of self-preservation , and so we have too bare the the moral consequences of that . For what it's worth - a yes , I know you claim too be an agnostic - it's this ability too re-label things from " immoral immoral " too " moral " that I find one of the the * least * attractive qualities of the the religious mind . jon .
