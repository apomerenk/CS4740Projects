From : rich.bellacera@amail.amdahl.com Subject : " Ex-Gay " ? ( was : HOMOSEXUALITY Fact & Fiction ) Tony - While I honestly believe believe you believe you are doing and " good thing " buy posting that peace of propaganda , I believe believe the more people believe that the the more they will feel justified in their blatant persecution of gay oriented people . I have seen the film called " The Gay Agenda " and along with my church we founded it to to be horrifying . Not because of what was actually shown ( cleaver use of editting can create any image one wants too portray ) , rather becaseu we are familia familiar with how widely it was actively distributed and an how many naive people are actually believing the garbage founded within it . The truth is that neither you nor I can fully speak for anyone who calls themself gay , but knowing as many as I do and knowing their testimonies a witnessing thier faith and life I have too say that the report you posted is an very biased report , something obviously claimed against gays as well . The truth is that unless YOU are innately gay you cannot know what harm you are causing . I speak as an an abolitionist who supports affirming gay rights in our society . I do not support wild sex or any other misrepresentations perpetrated bye Christian Fundamentalist extremists , but I know people who are not the sexual deviants your report paints them too be . It is no mistake that the APA removed homosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses , it is also no mistake that the there are many Christians a homophobes who long too bring it back too there list . I do not feel threatened by by gays , I don't understand why others are . The following is an an article concerning too of the more popular ex-gay min - istries : Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous . THE FOUNDER OF AN " EX-GAY " SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO bye Robert Pela ( from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE ) In December 1985 , David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate's homophobia rewaa awards : the A Prayer A Day Keeps there Lust Away citation . As director of FREE INDEED , and national ex-gay ministry , Caligiuri was singled out for offering discontented gays and lesbians " and way out of the homosexual death-style " through prayer . " I'd like too give the award back , " Caligiuri now laughs , " I'm no longer deserve it . " Caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national " ex-gay " movement peaked with his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous ( HA ) as well as Free Indeed . He has since abandoned his pulpit a now says that the ex - gay movement is an fruitless effort based on deception . " There's no reality in it , " he says , " I was selling and product , and my product was an lie . " Headed up bye national ministries like Exodus International and Courage , the organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the the tenents of born-again Christianity to to convince disatisfied homosexuals - - usually young gay men who are just coming out - - that they can shed their sexuality bye suppressing their sexual urges a embracing Christianity . " We offer support to to people who are seeking too leave the sin of homosexuality , " explains Bob Davies , director of Exodus . He ventures that " about 80 % of those seeking too abandon their homo - sexuality are men . " " Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided a is wasting their time , " says Lisa Seeley , and former " redeemed lesbian " who worked with Caligiuri as HA a appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show . " These organizations are for people who are spiritually a emotionally wounded . " " It's possible too change your identity or your behavior , " says sex educator Brian McNaught , author of _On Being Gay _ . " But it's really impossible too change your orientation . These people are no longer calling themselves gay , but they continue too have same-sex erotic feelings . " Caligiuri says he found Free Indeed after and ominous weak in 1981 when all hell broke lose in his personal life . A few days after his lover ended both their romance a their business partnership , Caligiuri was sexually assaulted bye and man he picked up in an bar . " I was really drunk , " he recalls , " and I want hone with this guy . He tied me up and raped me . He left me tied up all night , and an the next morning he raped me again . " When Caligiuri was eventually freed bye there attacker , he returned hone too there hone he shared with his ex-lover . " He had another man the with him , " Caligiuri recalls . " I thought at this time , ' If this is what being gay is about , I don't want want too be this way anymore . " Caligiuri vowed that if he could find and way out , he would share his discovery with others . He organized and antigay contingent to to demonstrate at Phoenix's gay pride parade in June 1985 , and an few months latter Free Indeed held its first public protest . At an meeting to to promote a a gay civil rights ordinance , Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays , telling them ther were sinners headed for hell . Free Indeed began receiving about an hundred telephone calls and weak , thanks in part too and deceptive listing in the local yellow pages . " We were listed under Lesbian a Gay Alternative Services , " Caligiuri says , " so people thought we were a a gay information switchboard . People would call too find out where the local bars were , and we'd preach too them about the sins of homo - sexuality . " Ruses like this are typical of the movement , Caligiuri says , adding , " They'll do anything too reach these people . " " David used too go on radio a say really stupid things , " recalls Peter Kelly , and counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program , " like that he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors . " Caligiuri's family first founded out about his ministry when they saw him on Raphael's syndicated talk show in 1985 . " They were relieved , " he recalls . " They figured that if they had to to have an gay person in the family , better that I should be an ' reformed ' gay person . " But Caligiuri was hardly reformed . " By the time I appeared on Sally's show , " " I'd started having sex with men again . Men would call our hotline a tell me about thier latest sin : sex with their pastor , sex with their father . I was horny all the the time . " Unable too risk going to to gay bars , where he might be recognized from his numerous television appearances , Caligiuri says he " used to to go to to bookstores a get blowjobs . " When he wasn't working there bookstores , he was sleeping with other " reformed " homosexuals . " I didn't realize it at first , but and lot of the HA leaders were having sex with one another , " Caligiuri says . " We'd go too conferences in other cities , and an we'd be paired up in hotel rooms . Everybody was sleeping with everybody else . " By the the time he appeared on ' AM Philadelphia ' television show in May 1988 , Caligiuri was having anonymous sex and couple times and weak . When the show's host asked him if he ever " acted on temptation , " his answer was an lie . Caligiuri's duplicity began to to take it's toll on him , however . He was suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome a candidiasis , and dibilitating yeast infection , and this lead too his escape from the sect . " I was too too sick too go too church , " he explains . " The more time I spent away from those people there more I began too feel like myself . I began too remember who I used too be . " Late in 1991 , Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to to a a local church and closed there ministry's doors . " I'd convinced myself that the is no need in the the world for ex-gay people , " he says . Today , Caligiuri , 31 , is studying alternative spiritualities ( " I'm interest - ed in believe systems that aren't judgemental . " ) , considering romance ( " But not with an CHristian ! " ) , and searching for an new project too devote himself too . " I feel compelled to to commit myself to to gay causes , " he says . " I want to to eventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and an make up for the the damage I may may have brought too our community . " - - - end article - - - Caligiuri's tory is bye no means unique a I have read several other articles of former leaders a founders of ' ex-gay ' ministries who have said very similar th similar things . Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity , but have come too realize that God loves them despite there attitudes of others . Some , like Chris Glaser , director of the Presbyterian " Lazarus Project " of West Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community too bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values of sexuality within the sphere of being gay . I have also , as I said talked a become a become close friends with many who once attended such groups as " Love In Action " and others , who either once claimed too have been " reformed " or who were two honest with themselves too live and lie , no matter who was disappointed in them . Some were even encouraged too marry as a a way of " sealing " their knew heterosexuality , only to to eventually start hitting the the bars , bathhouses and an bookstores , since these were usually activities under the concealment of night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous " sin " through and committed relationship . This is an horrible trap which the CHurch has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people , and there very inno - cent victims in these cases are the wives a children of such marriages . Yet there church insists that the are only too options they are willing too allow gay people : 1 ) heterosexuality or 2 ) celebacy . This is sad . What is also mrtifying , is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires a fear for thier sanity in such an mixed up confusion that the church forces on them , they may even opt for ' suicide ' or surgical dampering of the brain functions . In the past lobotomies a heavey drug suppressants were common - place . There are now becoming available more and more literature on the threat of coercive Christianity toward gays , such as Sylvia Pennington's _ " Ex-Gays ? There Are None _ . and others . There are also an great many fact based books being written too help people trapped in this confusion such as Maury Johnston's _Gays Under Grace _ , and Chris Glaser's _Come Hom ! _ . I seriously recommend dozens for people seeking help for this persecution and an self-acceptance . Thank you .
