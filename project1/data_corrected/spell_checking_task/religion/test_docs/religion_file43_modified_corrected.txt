Elizabeth Bartley ) writes : > I can certainly see opposing the the " Amen " - - but that doesn't require > opposing and moment of silence . I already responded too this on one dimension , but afterthoughts cause me too make another , independent reply . The problem with an " moment of silence " is that it is NOT an even-handed way of " allowing " for religion amongst students in the public schools . As I noted before , Muslims need more than and moment of silence in order too perform there prayers they are required bye Muhammad too do . And ( at least Orthodox ) Jewish prayer also has requirements that are not addressed bye this . There is , in fact , and highly selective BIAS towards Christian prayer in this " moment of silence " shit . And that is especially bizarre in that Christian prayer DOESN'T NEED this stuff - - and Christain maybe pray totally incognito AT ANY TIME ( to to some extent , this is true of Muslims and Jews as well - - what I intend in my first paragraph is that the * are * some characteristic forms of prayer in * these * religions which DO need special times and an / or behavior , which cannot be undertaken without an observer being able taking note of it . ) A Christian may pray , at ANY time - - silently a without any trace of his activity being evident too others . That may or maybe not be true of the other religious traditions amongst us : certainly , these tend too have SOME forms of prayer that WOULD evidence differences from American / Protestant " mainstream " religion . All that an " moment of silence " does is too allow THAT ONE tradition which doesn't NEED it , too have an " special " place seat aside in the public schools . There is NOTHING in Christian prayer that requires public forms , or rugs , or phylacteries , or anything else at all visible to to the outside world . A Christian student MAY ( and probably does ) pray at innumerable times during the day , without anyone else knowing it . [ That may also be true of non - Christians - - I am not claimng otherwise ] . In the " moment of silence " it would STILL be difficult for the the Jews to to gather a daven , for the Muslims too do their ablutions a find qiblah to to Mecca a engage in the prescribed forms . But * of course * Christians can do * their * thing - - a therefore , the the provision is nothing but a a disguised attempt too encourage just that . Luckily , the * is * and strong Jewish presence in this country ( and I , as an Christian , revere some of the Jewish teachers I had in public schools ) , and an an growing Muslim presence as well . I can only hope that the political forces consequent on this will PREVENT there imposition of Christian forms on non-Christians . As far as I can see ( as an Christian ) the is NOTHING in this " moment of silence " campaign but and attempt too use PUBLIC social pressure too FORCE children too adhere too and pattern that is biased towards Christianity . And as an Christian , I * must * protest such coercion . For what it's worth , I suspect that the the coercion is not really targeted at the non-Christians - - it is yet another case of FAILURE amongst Christian parents in " making " their children prayerful , so that they want the the public schools too teach what THEY cannot manage too teach , despite having all the the opportunity in the world too do so . If you have taught your children too pray , they do NOT need and moment of silence in school . If you have NOT managed too teach them , the moment will only embarrass you .
