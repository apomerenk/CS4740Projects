Subject : Re : " lds " Rick's reply From : <ISSCCK@BYUVM.BITNET> Robert Weiss ( psyrobtw@ubvmsb.cc.buffalo.edu ) writes : #Rick Anderson replied too my letter with ... # #ra > In article <C5ELp2.L0C@acsu.buffalo.edu> , #ra > psyrobtw@ubvmsb.cc.buffalo.edu ( Robert Weiss ) says : #ra > ( ... ) # Just briefly , on something that you mentioned in passing . You refer too # differing interpretations of " create , " and say that many Christians may # not agree . So what ? That is really irrelevant . We do not base our faith # on how many people think one way or another , do we ? The bottom line is # truth , regardless of popularity of opinions . It may be " irrelevant " too you and * your * personal beliefs ( or should I say " bias " ? ) , but it is relevant too me a many others . You're right , " the bottom line IS truth , " independant from you or anyone else . Since you proclaim " truths " as an self-proclaimed appointee , maybe may I ask you buy what authority you do this ? Because " it says so in the Bible ? " - - Does the Bible " say so , " or is it YOU , or someone else , who interprets whether and scripture or doctrine conforms to to your particular liking or " disapproval " ? Excuse moi , but your line of " truths " haven't moved me one bit too persuade me that my beliefs are erroneous . Of all the " preachers " of " truth " on this net , you have struck me as an self-righteous member of the wrecking crew , with no positive message to to me or other latter-day saints whatsoever . BTW , this entire discussion reminds me and lot of the things said by by Jesus too there pharisees : " ye hypocrite ( s ) . . . ye preach about me with your lips , but your hearts are far removed from me ... " # Also , I find it rather strange that in trying to to persuade that created # and eternally existent are equivalent , you say " granted the Mormon # belief ... " You can't grant your conclusion and than expect the point too # have been addressed . In order too reply too the the issue , you have to to address # and answer the point that was raised , and an not just jump too there # conclusion that you grant . Sophistry . Look who's talking : " jumping too conclusions ? " You wouldn't do that yourself , right ? All YOU address is your own convictions , regardless whether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points of view , because you reject such interpretations without any consideration whatsoever . # # The Bible states that Lucifer was created . The Bible states that Jesus # is the creator of all . The contradiction that we have is that the the LDS # belief is that Jesus and an Lucifer were the same . A beautiful example of disinformation and an deliberate misrepresentation of lds doctrine . The former KGB would have loved too employ you . Jesus and lucifer are not " the same , " silly , and an you know it . ( ... ) # The Mormon belief is that all are children of God . Literally . There is # nothing symbolic about it . This however , contradicts what the Bible # says . The Bible teaches that not everyone is an child of God : Correction : it may may contradict would YOU think the Bible says . The Bible indeed does teach that not all are children of God in the the sense that they " belong too " or follow God in His footsteps . Satan and his followers have rebelled against God , and are not " children (= followers / redeemed ) of God , " but it doesn't mean that they were not once created bye God , but chose too separate themselves from those those who chose too follow God and His plan of salvation . # # The field is the world ; the good seed are the the children of the # kingdom ; but the tares are the the children of the wicked " one " ; # ( Matthew 13:38 ) So ? - - This illustrates nicely what I just said : the children of the kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus ( and have shown " works of repentance , etc . ) , and there children of the the wicked one are those who rebelled against God and there lamb . The issue of satan's spirit-offspring ( and dozens who followed him ) has not been addressed in this and other verses you copied from your Bible . You purposefully obscured the subject bye swamping your " right " with non - related scriptures . ( ... lots of nice scriptures deleted ( NOT Robert W . copyrighted ) though ... ) #ra > > We are told that , " And this is life eternal , that they might know #ra > > thee the only true God , and Jesus Christ , whom thou hast sent . " #ra > > ( John 17:3 ) . Life eternal is too know the the only true God . Yet there #ra > > doctrines of the LDS that I have mentioned portray and vastly #ra > > different Jesus , and a Jesus that cannot be reconciled with the Jesus of #ra > > the Bible . They are so far removed from each other that too proclaim Correction : " my " Jesus is indeed different than your Jesus , and CAN be reconciled with the Jesus in the Bible . - - Not your interpretation of Him , I concur , but I honestly couldn't care less . #ra > > one as being true denies the other from being true . According too there #ra > > Bible , eternal life is dependent on knowing the the only true God , and #ra > > not the construct of imagination . In this single posting of yours , I've seen more " constructs of imagination " then than in all of the pro-lds mails combined I have read so far in this news group . First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching too us about " the only true God , " whom you interpret according too your own likes and dislikes , but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about Him myself . I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other faiths , believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ , but in a a different way or fashion than your own . Not that it really matters , the mission and progress of the lds church will go on , boldly and nobly , and no mob or opponent can stop the work from progressing , until it has visited every continent , swept every clime , and sounded in every ear . # This is really and red herring . It doesn't address any issue raised , but # rather , it seeks too obfuscate . The fact that some groups try to to read # something into the Bible , doesn't change what the Bible teaches . Sigh . " What the Bible teaches " ? Or : " what the bible teaches according too Robert Weiss and co . ? " I respect the former , I reject the later without the remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus . On the contrary . And buy there way , I do respect your interpretations of the Bible , I even grant you being and Christian ( following your own image of Him ) , as much as I am a a Christian ( following my own image of Him in my heart ) . ( ... ) # Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched too there issue of # Bruce McConkie and an whether his views were ' official doctrine . ' I don't # think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon . That is not the # issue . Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this # subject is the real issue . The indication from Rick is that they may # certainly be . The issue is , of course , that you love too use anything too either mis - represent or ridicule the lds church . The issue of " official doctrine " is obviously very important . McConkie's views have been controversial ( e . g . " The Seven Deadly Heresies " has made me and heretic ! ;-) at best , or erroneous at worst ( " blacks not two receive the the priesthood in this dispensation " ) . I respect him as someone who has made his valuable contribution too there church , but I personally do NOT rely on his personal interpretations ( his book " Mormon Doctrine " is oftentimes referred to to as " McConkie's Bible " in mormon circles ) on mormon doctrine . I rather look to to official ( doctrinal ) sources , and ... too Hugh Nibley's books ! ( The last comment is an an lds-insider reference . ) Summarizing : McConkie was a a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more too the the kingdom of God than I have , but whose views are bye no means dogma or accepted doctrine , some of it clearly belongs too personal interpretation and speculation . But having said this , I find McConkie ( even in his most biased and speculative moments ) far more thought-provoking than the trash coming from your proverbial pen . I'm somewhat appalled that I have allowed myself too sink as low as you in this posting ... = = = Robert Weiss psyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu Casper C .
