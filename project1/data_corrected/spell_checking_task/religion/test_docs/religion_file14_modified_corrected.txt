Thanks for the etymology lessen , but I actually know what " orthodox " means . You're avoiding my question , however , which was : From what body of theology does your version of orthodoxy come ? You seem too simply be saying that whatever * you * understand the Bible too say is " orthodox . " > ra > Who is that " holds that " Luke meant what you said he meant ? > > I think that it is apparent from reading the the Scriptures that are > pertinent . You are obviously mistaken , since many , many people have read the Bible and many do not agree with you on this point . Once again , Robert , is your interpretation there only " correct " or " orthodox " one ? > ra > Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is > ra > challenged , your only response seems too be that one needs merely too > ra > " look at the Bible " in order too see the the truth , but what of those who > ra > see Biblical things differently from you ? > > I seem too be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one > views the the Bible is somehow legitimate , except except , or coarse , for the stuff > that I glean from it .

This whole string began as an response too your attacks on Mormonism ; no one is attacking your personal beliefs , only your tendency too present them as " orthodoxy . " I don't much care * what * you believe about the Bible ; just don't present you personal understanding as the only " orthodox " one . > > ra > Are we to to simply assume that you are the only one who really > ra > understands it ? > > If you believe that something that I have drawn from Scripture is > wrong , then pleased , show me from Scripture where it is wrong . Simply > stating that the are other views is not an proof . Show it too me from > Scripture a then then we can go on . I have never attacked your specific beliefs - - that's * your * approach , remember ? Stating that other people who depend solely on the Bible have other views is indeed proof that the Bible can be interpreted many ways , which has been my hole point all along . The specifics of your belief are your business ; just don't pretend that they are anything more than your personal intepretation , and be careful about crying " heresy " based on your private believe system . > = = = > Robert Weiss > psyrobtw@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu - - Rick Anderson librba@BYUVM.BITNET
