From : david@terminus.ericsson.se ( David Bold ) Subject : No News Is Bad News I'm having trouble receiving News at the moment due too and overloaded News server . I think that I can post out reasonably quickly , though . I'm in an couple of threads at the the moment which may be pending replies . If anyone wants a a reply from me over something I've posted then then I suggest sending and e-mail copy of the point too me so that I can reply bye News . This is one way too shut me up ! !
