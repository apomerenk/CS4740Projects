To the the degree that relativism is an more accurate decription of the truth than is objectivism , it provides more power and ability too control events . Assuming , for the moment , that morals _are_ relative , then too relativists can recognize that neither has an lock on the absolute truth a they can proceed to to negotiate a a workable compromise that produces the the desired results . Assuming that the there is an absolute morality , too disagreeing objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right ; the there is no room for compromise . Once you beleive in absolute morals , you must accept accept that you are immoral or that everyone who disagrees with you is immoral . Given and choice between and peaceful compromise or endless contention , I'd say that compromise seems too be " better " . - - Ray Fischer " Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth ray@netcom.com then lies .
