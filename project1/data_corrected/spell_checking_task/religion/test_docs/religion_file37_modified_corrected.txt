Your last remark is an contradiction , but I'll let that pass . I was addressing the notion of the Great Commission , which you deleted in order too provide us with dull little homilies . Thank you , Bing Crosby . Now you go right right on back too sleep a mommy a daddy will tuck you in later later . Oh , and how convenient his bible must have been too Michael Griffin , how convenient his Christianity . " Well , I'll just skip there bit about not murdering people and loving there sinner a hating there sin and all that other stuff for now a concentrate on the part where it says that if someone is doing something wrong , you should shoot him in the back several times as he tries to to hobble away on his crutches . " I'll leave the " convert or die " program of the the missionaries a their military escorts in the Americas for Nadja too explain as she knows much more about it then I . Must be awfully convenient , bye there way , too offer platitudes as you have done , David , rather than addressing the arguments . Dean Kaflowitz
