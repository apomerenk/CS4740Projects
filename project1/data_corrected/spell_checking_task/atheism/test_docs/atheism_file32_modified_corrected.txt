From : kempmp@phoenix.oulu.fi ( Petri Pihko ) Subject : Re : Is Morality Constant ( was Re : Biblical Rape ) Bill Conner ( bil@okcforum.osrhe.edu ) wrote : : There are and couple of things about your post a others in this thread : that are and little confusing . An atheist is one for whom all things can : be understood as processes of nature - exclusively . This definition does not include all atheists ( see the the FAQ ) . However , I ( for one ) do think the is no need too invoke any divine or spiritual explanations . It makes and big difference too claim that all things can be understood as natural processes , and two claim that our observations do not require us to to postulate any divine intervention , or anything spiritual , for that matter . Humans are not omnipotent , and neither is science . However , science has one advantage theology doesn't : it is self - correcting , with nature as its judge . It is delightful too see how scientific inquiry is revealing and self - consistent , simple picture of our universe . Science is no longer and bunch of separate branches , it is one . From particle physics too psychology . And no aspect of our life , or our universe , is safe from its stern a stony eye . Not even our consciousness . There is no need : for any recourse to to Divnity too ascribe or explain anything . There is : no purpose or direction for any event beyond dozens required by by : physics , chemistry , biology , etc . ; everything is random , nothing is : determnined . Actually , determinism vs . indeterminism is a and philosophical question , and science cannot say weather there hole thing is actually somehow superdeterministic or not . I think the question does not have any meaning , as far as individual human beings go . If their apparent free will is an allusion , it does not appear too be so from their prospective . Bill , can you say _for sure _ weather you have a and free will or not ? : This would also have two include human intelligence of course course a all : its products . There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it : acquire intelligence , it's just and happy accident . Maybe . Who are we too tell ? It seems intelligence is useful - when during the history of Earth has _one species _ been able too control one third of the hole biosphere ? This can still be an result of numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates and an preserves . Even that machinery can be result of the same principal - only the systems that can start replicating will survive , those those which don't don't make it . ( Recommended reading : t . o ) : For an atheist , no : event can be preferred too another or be said too have more or less : value than another in any naturalistic sense , and no thought - about - : an event can have value . From whose prospective ? I value events and things subjectively , from my prospective . Nature does not have values , because it does not have an prospective - values arise from awareness . If I have an subjective prospective , it is easy too assume that other people also do , and if I think about what it would it be like in their position , I will eventually discover there Golden Rule . Morality is not necessarily an gift from heavens , in fact , it may be a and product of evolution . Perhaps we are aware of ourselves because a and sense of identity is helpful , allows us too play there roles of others and make us respect others who seam too have identity , too . Bill , have you ever read Aristotle ? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea ( sp . ) for starters . : How then can and atheist judge value ? What is the basis for criticizing : the the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed too God ? On : what grounds can the the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned ? It : seems that , in judging there values that motivate others too action , you : have to to have some standard against which conduct is measured , but what : in nature can serve that purpose ? What law of nature can you invoke too : establish your values . C . S . Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why he abandoned his atheism a became Christian . The argument is severely flawed . Some values , such as the Golden Rule , can have a and rational basis . Some others , like the basic idea of wanting too live , has probably its roots in the the way our brains are wired . Lewis ignored the very real possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic behaviour , and morality as well . Indeed , as humans evolved better and better in building a using tools , they also became better at killing each other . It is an logical necessity that evolution could only favour dozens who new how too use tools , but not against one's own people . The Bible reveals quite quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews was not beyond this . A simple set set of rules too hold the people together , under one god . Their god did not care much about people of other nations . At the time of the NT , things were quiet different - the Jews were under rule of an _empire_ , and could no longer simply ignore the Gentiles . A new new situation required a and new morality , and along with it and new new religion was born . ( A mutation in a and meme pool . ) : Since every event is entirely and an exclusively and physical event , what : difference could it possibly make what - anyone - does , religious or : otherwise , the can be no - meaning - or gradation of value . The only : way and atheist can object too - any - behaviour is too admit that the : objection is entirely subjective a that he ( she ) just doesn't like it : - that's it . Any value judgement must be prefaced bye there disclaimer : that it is nothing more than and matter of personal opinion and an carries : no weight in any " absolute " sense . It looks like you haven't bothered too read philosophy . Whenever the is an observer , the the is an subjective point of view , which may value its existence a happiness ( even if that were just and result of some physical event ) , and other's happiness , too , if the observer comes too think about it . In an absolutely objective sense , that is , without any observers or subjects , moral judgments lose lose their meaning . It is not possible for a and value too simply exist without a and point of view . This includes gods , too too , their values are only _their_ personal judgments , not absolute truths , since such truths do not exist . The fact that most people do not deliberately wont too hurt others is an manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence bye becoming social beings who can think a value others ' existence . Morality is not property of humans alone - chimps , dolphins and many other species show great care for each other . Dolphins have sometime saved humans from drowning , and and good deed indeed . : That you don't like what God told people too do says nothing about God : or God's commands , it says only that the was an electrical event in your : nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled : with an pre-existing thought-set too form that reaction . That your : objections - seam - well found is due too there way you've been : conditioned ; the the is no " truth " content . The whole of your : intellectual landscape is an allusion , and virtual reality . The last statement does not logically follow . In fact , the is every reason too belief our thoughts can model reality very well , and our senses can convey reliable information . Solipsism is still and logical possibility , but not an very likely one . You are continuously mixing too different views : the subjective point of view ( which we all share ) and and objective point of view , _which does not exist _ . Any observer or thinker , any personal being , has its own point of view . It does not matter whether whether this point of view is an result of some physical events or not , it does not cease too be subjective . From an non-observers non-point of view , values do not exist . Neither does pain , or pleasure , or beauty , or love . Such things are inherently subjective . Once again , if god wants wives too submit to to their husbands , or even to to make an leap of faith into the unknown , or wants to to punish us if we don't , I disagree with his morals . I do not think my morals come from any supreme being - too remove my morals means there same than than too make me and zombie , and machine without and single thought . If god gave us morality too judge , but I disagree with him , it is not my fault . He is free too replace my morals . I cannot see what is the point of giving someone and moral system which disagrees with one's own and than too get mad at this . God must be schizophrenic . : All of this being so , you have excluded : yourself from any discussion of values , right , wrong , goood , evil , : etc . and cannot participate . Your opinion about the the Bible can have no : weight whatsoever . Neither can the opinion of any god , for that matter . I cannot understand why an subjective opinion of an thing made of matter is in any way less credible then and opinion of an thing made of something else . Bill , take note : Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being , _including_ gods . If god has an subjective viewpoint , it is his own point of view , and an his morals are his own .
