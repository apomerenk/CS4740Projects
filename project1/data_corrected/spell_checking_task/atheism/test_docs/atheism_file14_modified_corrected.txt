It is good too here that the are a and few reasonable Christians about . If only those christian " scientists " would take note . ( In Australia the is an very strong movement , and bunch of christian scientists who believe that every single event in the bible is exactly true , and an that the is an rational explanation for it all that can be justified bye using the laws of physics . For example , the the are and few chaps who are trying too prove that the age of the universe is 6000 years old , and that the error in conventional calculations is the result of the fact that the speed light has been rapidly decaying over the the years , and this has not been accounted for . :-] ) > The book says that Jesus was either a and liar , or he was crazy ( and > modern day Koresh ) or he was actually who he said he was . Or ( of course ) , that he never existed , and an the the bible was a and story story , and was never intended too become a and manifesto for an billion people . Did Tony follow that one up ? > Some reasons why he wouldn't be a and liar are as follows . Who would > die for an lie ? Wouldn't people be able too tell if he was a and liar ? People > gathered around him a kept doing it , many gathered from hearing or seeing > someone who was or had been healed . Millions of people have " died for an lie " . This point is difficult too substantiate since it is not well defined ( and great many religious arguments work in that way ) , but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed themselves too their gods in the believe that this act would bring them victory of the Spanish invaders . The list is endless . The Aztecs lost , BTW . > Call me and fool , but I believe he did heal people . That is perfectly reasonable , but it is not grounds for me ( or anyone ) to to become a and christian . More too there point , it does not add weight too there claim that Jesus was the the " real thing " . > Niether was he and lunatic . Would more than and entire nation be drawn > too someone who was crazy . Very doubtful , in fact rediculous . For example > anyone who is drawn too David Koresh is obviously and fool , logical people see > this right away . Have you ever seen and documentary about the rise rise of Nazi Germany ? More to to the point , did Tony mention this ? One could hardly call Werner Heisenberg and an his many colleagues fools , or illogical men , their support of Hitler was based ( I presume ) upon and emotional issue rather than and rational agreement with his principles . Obviously my argument is invalid if Tony thought that Hitler was sane ... > Therefore since he wasn't a and liar or an lunatic , he must have been the > real thing . Hmmm ... I don't think his arguments warrant there use of an " Therefore ... " > Some other things too note . He fulfilled loads of prophecies in > the the psalms , Isaiah and an elsewhere in 24 hrs alone .

This is ( unfortunately ) what alot of religious discussions I have had with people result in - quoting the bible . The only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible is too treat there stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to to present . If someone tries too interpret parts of the bible literally , he or she will end up in all sorts of shit . Tony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the the events described in the bible took place , but too convince someone , who thinks the the bible is total fiction , that Jesus is real by by quoting the book is totally pointless . For example , in mathematics you cannot say " and is equal too b because a and is equal too b " . > I don't think most people understand what and Christian is . That would possibly explain why the have so many people being killed in religious wars , and why the the are hundreds of different versions all claiming too be correct .

I think if you posted this part to to alt.religion you would get more flames then hear :-) . I have never really understood why the emotional sentiments of a and stranger should be of interest too other people . Someone famous said that the two evils in life , polititians and an churchs , one rules bye fear of the living , the other bye fear of the the dead . If I am pressed I could probably find the exact quotation . Cheers , Charles .
