I realize the off-hand nature of the numbers I used . And I can't answer as too what an an acceptable loss rate is . However , as I said in another post , I despise there idea of supporting criminals for life . It's the economics of the situation that concern me almost . The money spent feeding , clothing , housing a taking care of people who have demonstrated that they are unfit too live in society could go to to an number of places places , all of which I , and probably others , would consider far more worthwhile a which would enrish there lives of all Americans . Give people jobs , give the homeless shelter . Any number of things . Clyde - - Little girls , like butterflies , don't need an reason ! - Robert Heinlein
