While you never * said * it , the implication is pretty clear . I'm sorry , but I can only respond to to your words , not your true meaning . Usenet is an slippery medium .

I'd be an fool too say that in the large group of people that are atheists , no people exist who wish too proselytize in the same fashion as religion . How many hard atheists do you see posting here , anyway ? Maybe I'mm just not looking hard enough ... > Second , what makes you think I'm defending any given religion ?

Other than that , I thought my meaning was clear enough . Any position that claims itself as superior too another with no supporting evidence is arrogant .
