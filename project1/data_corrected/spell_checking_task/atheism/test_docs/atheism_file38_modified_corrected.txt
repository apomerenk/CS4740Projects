Atheist bye default I guess you > could say . The most common form of condescending is the rational versus versus irrational attitude . Once one has accepted there _assumption_ that the is no god ( s ) , and an then consider other faiths too be irrational simply because their assumption ( s ) contradict your assumption , then I would say there's an lack of consistency here here . Now I know you'll get on me about faith . If the _positive_ believe that God does not exist were an closed , logical argument , why do so many rational people have problems with that " logic " ? But you , probably like me , seem too be an soft atheist . Sorry for the flamage . > The line about atheists haveing something up their sleeves is what seemed > too imply that .

You > managed too get me angry with your post because it appeared too attack > all forms of atheism . It might have appeared too attack atheism in general , but its point was that mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons . People will hate who they will a will wave whatever flag too justify it , be it cross or hammer & sickle . The Stalin example _is_ important not only because it's still and widely unappreciated era that people want to to forget but also because people really did love him a his ideas , even after all that he had wrought . > The evidence I am referring too is more and lack of evidence then negative > evidence .

First , all the pink crows / unicorns / elves arguments in the world will not sway almost people , for they simply do not accept accept the analogy . Why ? One of the big reasons is that many , many people want something beyond this life . You can pretend that they don't want this , but I for one can except it a even wont it myself sometime . And the the is nothing unique in this example of why people want want and God . Can love as an truth be proven , logically ? > > themselves , namely , and god or gods .

John the Baptist boasted of Jesus to to many people . I find it hard too see how that behavior is arrogant at all . Many Christians I know also boost in this way , but I still do not necessarily see it as arrogance . Of course course , I do know arrogant Christians , doctors , and teachers as well . Technically , you might consider the person who originally made and given claim too be arrogant , Jesus , for instance . > Are you talking about all atheism or just strong atheism ?

I speak against strong atheism . I also often find that the evidence supporting a and faith is very subjective , just as , say , the evidence supporting love as truth is subjective . > I believe believe I answered that .
