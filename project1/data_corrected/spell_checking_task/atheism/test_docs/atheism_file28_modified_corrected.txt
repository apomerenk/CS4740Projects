IMNSHO , Abortion is the womans choice . Homosexual sex is the choice of the people involved . War is sometimes necessary . This leaves capital punishment . I oppose capital punishemnt because mistakes can happen ( yes this thread want around with no resolution recently ) . As far as poplulation control , I think contraception and an education are the best courses of action . > I would like to to understand how and atheist can object too war ( and an > excellent means of controlling population growth ) , or too capital > punishment , I'm sorry but the logic escapes me .
