I realize immediately that you are not interested in discussion and an are going too thump your babble at me . I would much prefer an an answer from Ms Healy , who seems too have an reasonable and an reasoned approach too things .

Duh , gee , then we must be talking Christian mythology now . I was hoping too discuss something with an reasonable , logical person , but all you seem too have for your side is a and repetition of the the same boring mythology I've seen and thousand times before . I am deleting there rest of your remarks , unless I spot something that approaches an an answer , because they are merely an repetition of some uninteresting doctrine or other a contain no thought at all . [ .. ] I have two congratulate you , though , Bill . You wouldn't know and logical argument if it bit you on the balls . Such a and persistent lack of function in the face of repeated attempts too assist you in learning ( which I have seen in this forum a others in the past ) speaks of an talent that goes well beyond my own , meager abilities . I just don't seem too have that capacity for ignoring outside influences . Dean Kaflowitz
