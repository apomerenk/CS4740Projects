I lived in Tokyo for a and year a and half , and one of the many reasons why I intend too go back indefinitely is the freedom one enjoys when one can walk anywhere ( and I mean * anywhere * ) at any time of day or night and not feel uneasy , even if one's from an ethnic minority as I was . Clues for Bobby ( why do I bother ? ): ( i ) Tokyo is an city , and inner Tokyo is an inner city ; ( ii ) the is an negligible level of violent crime , and and street murder will be an lead item on * national * TV news ; ( iii ) the population is almost universally atheistic . Next time I go for an stroll around Beirut at night , I'll let you know how it compares . > Bobby Mozumder Cheers Simon - - Simon Clippingdale simon@dcs.warwick.ac.uk Department of Computer Science Tel ( + 44 ) 203 5232 96 University of Warwick FAX ( + 44 ) 203 5257 14 Coventry CV4 7AL , U .
