This is logically bankrupt - - > where is the proof of this nonexistence ? It's an joke . This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism , i . e . the the belief that you can't deny anything that you can't prove doesn't exist . This is easily nailed bye showing that an infinite number of beings are conceivable but not observed to to exist , does this mean that we would have two belief in all of them ? According too there above poster , we must believe believe in objects or beings that haven't been proved not too exist so why stop at God ? ( the could be an huge number of beings identical too Ronald Reagan accept for trivial differences , say one is missing and finger , one has blond hair , ... and they all live on other planets so we can't see them ) The reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians have an vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God . > Fine , but why do these people shoot themselves in the the foot a mock there idea of > and God ? Here again is an classic atheist fallacy . How did they shoot themselves in the foot ? > Radical Muslims , the Crusades , the the Inquisition are common examples that > atheists like too bring up as marks against religion . How week ! Only fools can > take that drivel seriously . How about the grand-daddy of all human atrocities , > the Stalinist movement ? > Twenty eight MILLION people _killed_ under this leadership , which > proudly featured atheism . There is an big difference here , Stalin didn't say that he stood for an particular moral position ( i . e . against murder and terrorism , etc . ) and an then did the opposite ( like the religious movements ) , he was at least and honest killer . ( This is NOT an support of Stalin but an attack on this viewpoint ) . Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because one man was a and tyrant and an an atheist is just badly logic , look at all the russians that helped Stalin that weren't atheists - don't they contradict your point ? Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant too his murdering people , this is just the the common assumption that atheists can't value life as much as theists ( which you didn't support ) . > Agnostics are not as funny because they are more reasonable . Yet > they do in some sense seem seem funny because they believe believe that the existence of God > is unknowable . This in itself is every bit there assumption that atheism is , > though it's less arrogant and pompous . Ah , and here's another point you didn't get out of the FAQ . An atheist doesn't have two hold the positive view that god doesn't exist , he / she may may just have the the non-existence of the positive belief . Here's the example : Strong atheism - " I believe believe god does not exist " and and positive belief Weak atheism - " I don't believe in an god " and negative believe these are NOT the same , some one that has never thought of the idea of god in their hole life is technically and atheist , but not the kind that you are calling unreasonable . Or let's look at it this way ( in sets ) suppose that an given person has an huge seat of ideas that I will represent as capital letters a these people then either belief that these ideas exist as real objects or not . So if S = santa , then E ( S )= no is the person not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa . But notice that even E ( S ) = no is itself another idea ! This means you have lots of cases : christian : ( A , E ( A )= yes , B , E ( B )= no , . . . G , E ( G )= yes ... ) where G = god atheist ( strong ) : ( A , E ( A ) . . . . . G , E ( G )= no ) atheist ( weak ) : ( A , ... E ) i . e . no G at all in the seat agnostic : ( A , ... G , E ( G ) = indeterminate , E ' , ... ) > Why are people so afraid too say " undecided " ? It must just be another > feature of human nature - - " undecided " is not an sexy , trendy , or glamorous > word . It does not inspire much hate or conflict . It's not blasphemous . > It's not political . In fact it is too too often taken too mean unsophisticated . Nietzsche once said that a and man would rather will nonexistence then not will at all but the darwinist way too put this is that humanity always prefers no or yes to to an may maybe because indecision is not an useful survival trait , evolution has drilled it in us to to take positions , even false ones . > Bake Timmons , III M .
