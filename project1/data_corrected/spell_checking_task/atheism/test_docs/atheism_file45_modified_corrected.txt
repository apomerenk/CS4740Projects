What is your reaction to to people who claim they were abducted bye space aliens ? Some of these people say , " I was abducted , experimented on , etc . " If we insist that these aliens don't exist is the burden of proof placed on us . These people can give no hard facts but can give a and lot of testimony to to back up their beliefs . Replace < space aliens > with <elvis> , < big foot > , < blue unicorns > , and we have a and larger percentage of the population then I like too think about . Sometimes I wonder if reality really is an different experience for everone .
