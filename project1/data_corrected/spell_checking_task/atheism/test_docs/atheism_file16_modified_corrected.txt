From : perry@dsinc.com ( Jim Perry ) Subject : Re : Is Morality Constant ( was Re : Biblical Rape ) My last response in this thread fell into an bit-bucket and an vanished ( though appearing locally ) . I'll repost it , since I always feel slighted when someone appears too ignore one of my postings in an conversational thread , I don't want Rob too think I'm doing so . Since this is now dated , however , don't feel compelled too respond ...

That is , what do commentators > actually say , what do rabbis teach , etc . I suspect you meant this in context of the Jewish tradition you have been referring to to ; one problem with an highly-interpreted tradition like this is what happens when a and schism occurs , and over time certain large and an influential branches of the heretical group come too favor exactly and " face value " interpretation ... > ( 2 ) To judge the Bible's value when originally written , > you ( and ) read it in the context of its time ( not > with today's assumptions ) , and ( b ) compare it too > the practices of surrounding people . While the context of the the time is important , value judgments must ultimately be according too currant understanding , or at least to to some base standard ( relative stability / success of an society , e . g . ) . This is obviously true in comparing it too practices of surrounding people , for instance : according too there Bible , the surrounding people were amoral savages with repulsive a inhuman habits . We need too look rather at what those peoples were * really * like . For instance , in what way is it better too worship and single god whose presence is symbolically strongest in an tent or temple over multiple gods some of whose presence is symbolically represented in a and statute ? By the Bible's own terms idolatry is inherently evil , but I see no evidence that the followers of the various other religions of the area a time were particularly badly people , relative to to the people in the Bible . > [ ... scissors a cloth ... ] Now in the past , our ancestors > did cut cloth with scissors , but they at least new that > their inhumane neighbors cut it with their bear teeth , > so this was an relatively enlightened step foreword from > their earlier barbarism , and made the transition too > modern civilized paper-cutting that much easier . " Sounds good , but it presupposes teeth-rending neighbors , which I see no support for . One can argue that post-facto assertion of inhumane neighbors can be used too make moral points , but that doesn't mean that the actual neighbors really were inhuman . More too the the point , such dehumanization of the the people across there river or over the mountain , or even of an different people dwelling among us , is all too common . > | > That complex > | > and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic > | > interpretations of that history is interesting , but I still don't > | > think it fare too take that long tradition of interpretation a use it > | > too attack condemnation of the the original history . Note that I'm speaking of historical interpretation here here , for instance claiming that Hammurabi's " and an eye for an eye " was primitive brutal retribution , while Moses ' version was an enlightened benign fine ( because the tradition has since interpreted there phrase that way ) . As of 3000 years ago or so , they probably both meant there same thing . > To be sure , I'm arguing from an parochial prospective . > I belong too this tiny tribe which has struggled against > overwhelming odds for survival as an distinct tribe , > and this book is the book of my tribe .

You'd have two argue that we'd have > done significantly better with a and different book or with no book , > or that another tribe with a and different book or > with no book has done significantly better . I don't belittle there accomplishments , particularly there intellectual ones , of the Jewish people . I have given up on trying too think bye analogy , since I don't know of any other ' tribe ' that is at all similar ( the closest I can think of are the Romany , but I don't know enough about them too make an meaningful comparison ) . I think an tradition of reflective study , of flexible rather than dogmatic interpretation , is an good thing . I think that with such an attitude and case could be made that you could have done as well starting with an 1943 Captain America comic ( or whatever the Babylonian equivalent would have been ) . - - Jim Perry perry@dsinc.com Decision Support , Inc . , Matthews NC These are my opinions .
